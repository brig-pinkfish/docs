## Create Troubleshooting Playbooks from Customer Service Tickets

Let's get started with a powerful automation that creates troubleshooting playbooks from your customer service ticket data. This quickstart guide will walk you through creating a three-step automation to streamline your support process.

### Step 1: Read Customer Service Ticket Data

First, we'll read in the customer service ticket data. For this example, we'll use a sample dataset, but you can easily adapt this to your specific data source (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce).

1. Create a new automation in your dashboard.
2. Add a "Describe" step and enter the following instruction:
   ```
   Read customer service ticket data from the following URL: [SAMPLE_DATA_URL]
   Store the data in a variable called 'tickets'.
   ```
   Replace [SAMPLE_DATA_URL] with the actual URL we provide for the sample data.

### Step 2: Generate Playbooks from Tickets

Next, we'll loop through the tickets and create playbooks based on the conversations between customers and support agents.

1. Add another "Describe" step with the following instruction:
   ```
   Loop through each ticket in the 'tickets' variable.
   For each ticket, analyze the conversation between the customer and support agent.
   Create a troubleshooting playbook with step-by-step instructions based on the successful resolution of the issue.
   Store each playbook in a list called 'playbooks'.
   ```

### Step 3: Export Playbooks to Google Docs

Finally, we'll export the generated playbooks. In a real-world scenario, you might integrate directly with Google Docs. For this example, we'll prepare the playbooks for easy copy-pasting.

1. Add a final "Describe" step with this instruction:
   ```
   Format each playbook in the 'playbooks' list as a markdown document.
   Combine all formatted playbooks into a single markdown document.
   Display the final markdown document, ready for copying and pasting into Google Docs.
   ```

### Run Your Automation

Now that you've set up your three-step automation, it's time to run it:

1. Click the "Run" button to start your automation.
2. Watch as it processes the ticket data and generates playbooks.
3. When complete, you'll see the formatted playbooks ready for use.

Congratulations! You've just created an automation that turns customer service tickets into valuable troubleshooting playbooks. This can significantly improve your support team's efficiency and consistency.

### Next Steps

- Customize the playbook format to match your team's preferences.
- Integrate with your actual ticket system (e.g., Zendesk API) for live data.
- Set up a trigger to run this automation periodically to keep playbooks up-to-date.

Happy automating!
