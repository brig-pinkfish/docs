Let's get started with the simplest possible example.

### First: Write "Output Hello World"

Type `output hello world` in the chat entry. You should see Pinkfish respond with some commentary and a code block.

### Next: Run Your Automation

When it's done and you see the "Run" button, click it!

### Results

Hopefully you'll now see "Hello World" in your results box.

It should look like this:

Congratulations, you've just run your first step.
Happy automating!
