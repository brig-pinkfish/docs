## What can you do with it?

Search your knowledge base collections using semantic search. Get AI-generated answers from your documents, or retrieve raw search results with relevance scores. Filter by document names, metadata attributes, or date ranges for precise results.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: [your question]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**
- `search-query` - Your question or search terms in natural language

**Optional:**
- `action` - "ask" (default - AI answer) or "search" (raw results)
- `filters` - Filter results by document attributes
- `max-results` - Number of results to return (1-50, default: 10)
- `score-threshold` - Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0). Higher = more relevant but fewer results
- `rewrite-query` - Auto-rewrite query for better retrieval (true/false, default: false)

### Filter Format

Use simple expressions to filter search results:

```
filters: itemName = "TravelPolicy.pdf"
filters: area = "hr" AND content_type = "text/plain"
filters: date > "2024-01-01" OR filename = "handbook.pdf"
```

**Operators:** `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `AND`, `OR`

### Query Rewriting

The `rewrite-query` parameter controls whether your natural language query will be automatically rewritten before executing the vector search:

- `rewrite-query: true` - Automatically rewrites your query to improve retrieval performance, which can restructure or clarify ambiguous questions for better relevance
- `rewrite-query: false` - Your query is used exactly as provided (default)

Use query rewriting to improve recall for suboptimal or ambiguous queries. Disable it when you need full control and predictability over input, or for debugging and precise benchmarking.

## Examples

### Basic Question
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: what are expense policies
```
Get an AI-generated answer about expense policies.

### Raw Search Results (document chunks)
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: customer data formats
action: search
```
Get raw search results with relevance scores.

### Filter by Document
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: what are expense policies
filters: itemName = "TravelPolicy.pdf"
```
Search within a specific document only.

### Advanced Filter + Search
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: customer data formats
action: search
filters: area = "crm" AND content_type = "text/plain"
```
Get raw results filtered to CRM text documents.

### Tuned Search Results
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: API authentication methods
action: search
max-results: 20
score-threshold: 0.6
```
Get up to 20 highly relevant results with minimum 60% relevance score.

### Query Rewriting for Better Results
```
/knowledgebase-collection
search-query: how do I auth
action: search
rewrite-query: true
```
Automatically improve ambiguous or incomplete queries for better retrieval.

## Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "vectorStoreId": "vector store identifier",
  "response": "AI-generated answer (ask only)",
  "data": [{
    "file_id": "file identifier",
    "filename": "document name",
    "score": "relevance score",
    "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "content snippet"}]
  }]
}
```
