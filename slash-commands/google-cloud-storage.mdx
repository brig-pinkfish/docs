## What can you do with it?

Google Cloud Storage allows you to manage cloud storage objects programmatically. You can list all buckets in a project, upload files to specific buckets, download objects, manage object metadata, and organize your cloud storage resources. This integration is perfect for backup solutions, file storage workflows, and cloud-based content management.

## Notes 

File paths in bucket names use forward slashes (/) to create a folder-like structure. The content type is automatically detected for common file types when uploading. Storage classes include STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE, and ARCHIVE. When uploading files, text content can be provided directly, while binary files should be base64-encoded.
