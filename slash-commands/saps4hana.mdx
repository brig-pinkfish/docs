## Notes

SAP S/4HANA uses OData APIs for data operations. All invoice operations require valid company codes and supplier IDs. Filter criteria use OData query syntax with operators like eq (equals), ne (not equals), and contains. Date formats should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Currency codes must be valid ISO currency codes.
