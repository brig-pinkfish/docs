2. **Data Validation**: Validate required fields before creating invoices
3. **Batch Processing**: Use batch operations for multiple invoice creation
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain proper documentation for all financial transactions
5. **Performance**: Use filters and pagination for large data sets
6. **Security**: Ensure proper authorization for financial operations
