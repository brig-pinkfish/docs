## Notes 

File downloads require X-Paragon-Use-Raw-Response header set to 1 for binary content. File content returns as ArrayBuffer and should be converted to Uint8Array for proper handling. Always detect file type from extension for proper file handling. Binary types include pdf, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, zip. Text types include json, html, csv, xml, txt, md. Parent folder ID "0" represents the root folder. Path collections show folder hierarchy. Search supports enterprise-wide content discovery. File types indicate whether item is file, folder, or web_link. Supports both PinkConnect and Paragon proxy connections. Created_by and owned_by track user ownership. Item status indicates active or trashed state.
