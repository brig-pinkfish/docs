# ServiceNow

Manage IT service workflows with the ServiceNow platform for incident management, service requests, and IT operations.

## Overview

The ServiceNow skill provides essential functionality for:
- Creating and managing incidents
- Retrieving incident details and status
- Updating incident records and assignments
- Managing IT service workflows
- Tracking resolution progress

## Connection Requirements

This skill requires a ServiceNow connection configured through either:
- PinkConnect Proxy (PC_BASE_URL)
- Paragon Proxy (PARA_BASE_URL + "servicenow/")

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// Create a new incident
const incident = {
  "short_description": "Cannot connect to VPN",
  "description": "User is unable to establish a VPN connection from home network.",
  "caller_id": "Jane Smith",
  "priority": "3 - Moderate",
  "category": "Network"
};
```

## Key Features

### Incident Management
- **Create Incidents**: Generate new incident tickets with detailed information
- **Retrieve Incidents**: Get incident details using system ID
- **Update Incidents**: Modify incident status, assignment, and work notes
- **Track Progress**: Monitor incident resolution workflow

### Service Request Handling
- **Request Processing**: Handle various IT service requests
- **Assignment Management**: Assign incidents to appropriate teams
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor incident lifecycle from creation to resolution

## Common Operations

### Create an Incident
```javascript
POST: now/table/incident
{
  "short_description": "Email access issue",
  "description": "User reports being unable to access their email account.",
  "caller_id": "John Doe",
  "priority": "2 - High",
  "category": "Email"
}
```

### Get Incident Details
```javascript
GET: now/table/incident/{sys_id}
```

### Update Incident Status
```javascript
PUT: now/table/incident/{sys_id}
{
  "state": "In Progress",
  "assigned_to": "Jane Smith",
  "work_notes": "Issue acknowledged. Investigating VPN configuration settings."
}
```

## Priority Levels

- **1 - Critical**: System down, major business impact
- **2 - High**: Significant impact, urgent resolution needed
- **3 - Moderate**: Normal business impact
- **4 - Low**: Minor impact, can be scheduled
- **5 - Planning**: Future enhancement or non-urgent

## Incident States

- **New**: Incident just created, not yet assigned
- **In Progress**: Incident being actively worked on
- **On Hold**: Incident paused, waiting for information
- **Resolved**: Issue fixed, awaiting user confirmation
- **Closed**: Incident completed and verified
- **Canceled**: Incident canceled or invalid

## Response Structure

### Incident Response
```javascript
{
  "result": {
    "sys_id": "1234567890abcdef",
    "number": "INC0010001",
    "short_description": "Unable to access email",
    "description": "User reports being unable to access their email account.",
    "state": "New",
    "priority": "2 - High",
    "assigned_to": "John Doe",
    "opened_at": "2025-01-14 10:00:00",
    "resolved_at": null,
    "caller_id": "Jane Smith",
    "category": "Email"
  }
}
```

## Common Categories

### IT Categories
- **Hardware**: Computer, printer, phone issues
- **Software**: Application problems, license issues
- **Network**: Connectivity, VPN, Wi-Fi problems
- **Email**: Email access, configuration issues
- **Security**: Password resets, access requests
- **Telephony**: Phone system issues

### Service Categories
- **Request**: Service requests and provisioning
- **Inquiry**: Information requests
- **Complaint**: Service complaints
- **Change**: Change requests

## Important Notes

- **System ID**: Use sys_id for all update and retrieval operations
- **Incident Numbers**: Human-readable incident numbers (e.g., INC0010001) are auto-generated
- **Work Notes**: Use work_notes for internal communication, comments for customer-visible updates
- **Assignment**: Incidents can be assigned to users or groups
- **SLA Tracking**: ServiceNow automatically tracks SLA compliance
- **Escalation**: Incidents can be escalated based on priority and time

## Best Practices

1. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide comprehensive incident descriptions for faster resolution
2. **Proper Categorization**: Use appropriate categories for better routing and reporting
3. **Priority Assignment**: Set priorities based on business impact and urgency
4. **Regular Updates**: Update work notes regularly to track progress
5. **Caller Information**: Always include caller details for communication
6. **Resolution Documentation**: Document resolution steps for knowledge base
7. **Closure Verification**: Confirm resolution with the caller before closing incidents
