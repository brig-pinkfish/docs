## What can you do with it?

The `/perplexity` command gives you access to real-time web research powered by Perplexity's AI. You can get current news, analyze market trends, find academic papers, research any topic with up-to-date information, and even process files (PDFs, Word docs, Excel sheets) as part of your research queries.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/perplexity [your research question or topic]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `query` - Your research question or topic (e.g., "latest AI developments", "climate change policy updates")

**Optional:**

- `model` - AI model to use: `sonar` (default, fast), `sonar-pro` (advanced), `sonar-reasoning` (fast reasoning), `sonar-deep-research` (comprehensive)

- `max_tokens` - Maximum response length (default: 1000)

- `temperature` - Response creativity level (0-1, default: 0.7)

- `search_domain_filter` - Include or exclude specific websites (e.g., `["wikipedia.org", "cnn.com"]` or `["-pinterest.com"]`)

- `search_recency_filter` - Time period for results: `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"year"`

- `return_images` - Include images in results (true/false, default: false)

- `return_related_questions` - Include related questions (true/false, default: false)

- `search_context_size` - Amount of search context: `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`

- `response_format` - Structure output as JSON schema or regex pattern

- `file_urls` - Array of file URLs to process (supports PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, CSV)

  <Warning>This model can take longer to process. Use only when enhanced accuracy is critical.</Warning>
- **`sonar-deep-research`** - Expert-level research model for comprehensive reports
  <Warning>This model may take 30+ minutes. Use async endpoints for this model.</Warning>

### Reasoning Models  
- **`sonar-reasoning`** - Fast reasoning model with search capabilities
- **`sonar-reasoning-pro`** - Premier reasoning model powered by DeepSeek R1 with Chain of Thought
