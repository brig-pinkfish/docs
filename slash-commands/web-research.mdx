## Structured Data Responses

You can request structured data responses for complex information needs. This is helpful for getting organized information about a topic:

```
/perplexity what are the latest news and developments about Hilton Hotels? Include information about their recent expansions, business performance, and any notable changes in their services or loyalty program. Return as structured data with categories for recent developments, business performance, new properties, and loyalty program updates.
```

This will return a structured response with clearly organized information in categories.

## Example JSON Response Structure

For developers and advanced users who need structured data, you can request specific JSON formats:

```
/perplexity research recent AI developments and output in JSON format with categories for breakthroughs, companies, and applications
```

The system will return a structured JSON response like:

```json
{
  "breakthroughs": [
    {
      "title": "New Large Language Model",
      "description": "Details about the breakthrough",
      "date": "2023-05-15"
    }
  ],
  "companies": [
    {
      "name": "AI Corp",
      "focus": "Natural language processing",
      "recent_developments": "Description of recent work"
    }
  ],
  "applications": {
    "healthcare": "Description of healthcare applications",
    "finance": "Description of finance applications"
  }
}
```

### Advanced JSON Schema Example

For complex research needs, you can specify a detailed JSON schema structure. Here's an example for researching hotel company information:

```
/perplexity research Hilton Hotels with detailed JSON schema for recent developments, business performance, new properties, and loyalty program updates
```

Prodide your own schema like this:

```json
{
  "type": "json_schema",
  "json_schema": {
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "recent_developments": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "title": { "type": "string" },
              "summary": { "type": "string" },
              "date": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        },
        "business_performance": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "recent_revenue": { "type": "string" },
            "stock_performance": { "type": "string" },
            "growth_outlook": { "type": "string" }
          }
        },
        "new_properties": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "location": { "type": "string" },
              "opening_date": { "type": "string" },
              "property_type": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        },
        "loyalty_program_updates": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["recent_developments", "business_performance"]
    }
  }
}
```

This will generate a highly structured response that matches exactly the format you've specified, making it ideal for data analysis or integration with other systems.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "tell me about AI", try "what are the latest developments in AI language models for medical diagnosis"

2. **Request Format**: Specify how you want the information presented:
   ```
   /perplexity explain quantum computing breakthroughs
   format as bullet points
   focus on practical applications
   ```

3. **Time-Sensitive Queries**: For news and current events, specify timeframes:
   ```
   /perplexity what happened in renewable energy this week
   ```

4. **Multi-Part Questions**: Break complex queries into connected parts:
   ```
   /perplexity analyze the chip manufacturing industry
   focus on: new facilities, major players, investment trends
   timeline: past 6 months
   ```

5. **Request Specific Sources**: Direct research to trusted domains:
   ```
   /perplexity research climate change from sites: science.org, nature.com
   ```

## Tips for Quality Results

- Use clear, specific questions
- Specify your preferred format (bullet points, categories, timeline, JSON)
- Indicate if you want academic, news, or business focus
- Mention time periods when relevant (day, week, month, year)
- Request specific types of sources if needed
- Ask for comparisons or trends rather than just facts
- Specify the depth of analysis you want
- Request a specific AI model for your particular needs

## Limitations

- Cannot access private or paywalled content
- May have a slight delay in real-time events
- Best for factual research rather than opinion-based topics
- Sources are limited to publicly available information
- File processing only works with documents (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, CSV)
- Image processing is not supported
