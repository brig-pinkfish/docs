## Notes 

Campaign types include regular, plaintext, rss, and variate. Contact status can be subscribed, unsubscribed, cleaned, or pending. Lists require complete contact information including company address. Subscriber hash is used for updating contacts and can be the MD5 hash of the email address. Uses Paragon proxy connection. Campaign content and templates are managed separately from campaign settings. Merge fields like FNAME and LNAME are used for personalization.
