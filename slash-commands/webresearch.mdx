## Using Perplexity

The `/perplexity` command helps you get up-to-the-minute information from across the internet, powered by Perplexity's AI research capabilities.

## Basic Usage

Simply type your question or research topic after the command:

```
/perplexity what are the latest developments in quantum computing
```

```
/perplexity who won the champions league final yesterday
```

```
/perplexity give me the current stock price of Apple and recent news
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "tell me about AI", try "what are the latest developments in AI language models for medical diagnosis"

2. **Request Format**: Specify how you want the information presented:
   ```
   /perplexity explain quantum computing breakthroughs
   format as bullet points
   focus on practical applications
   ```

3. **Time-Sensitive Queries**: For news and current events, you can specify timeframes:
   ```
   /perplexity what happened in renewable energy this week
   ```

4. **Multi-Part Questions**: Break complex queries into connected parts:
   ```
   /perplexity analyze the chip manufacturing industry
   focus on: new facilities, major players, investment trends
   timeline: past 6 months
   ```

## Tips for Quality Results

- Use clear, specific questions
- Specify your preferred format (bullet points, categories, timeline)
- Indicate if you want academic, news, or business focus
- Mention time periods when relevant
- Request specific types of sources if needed
- Ask for comparisons or trends rather than just facts
- Specify the depth of analysis you want

## Limitations

- Cannot access private or paywalled content
- May have a slight delay in real-time events
- Best for factual research rather than opinion-based topics
- Sources are limited to publicly available information
