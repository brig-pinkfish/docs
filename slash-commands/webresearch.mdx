## Using The Web Research Command

The `/webresearch` command helps you get up-to-the-minute information from across the internet, powered by Perplexity's AI research capabilities.

## Basic Usage

Simply type your question or research topic after the command:

```
/webresearch what are the latest developments in quantum computing
```

```
/webresearch who won the champions league final yesterday
```

```
/webresearch give me the current stock price of Apple and recent news
```

## Key Features

### Real-Time News Search
Get the latest news and developments on any topic:
```
/webresearch what are the latest climate policy changes in the EU
```

### Academic Research
Find and summarize recent scientific papers and discoveries:
```
/webresearch show me recent peer-reviewed studies on gut microbiome
```

### Market Analysis
Get current financial data and market trends:
```
/webresearch analyze recent trends in electric vehicle sales in Europe
```

## Formatting Options

### Bullet Points
Request specific formatting:
```
/webresearch summarize SpaceX's recent launches in bullet points
```

### Categories
Ask for categorized information:
```
/webresearch break down AI safety initiatives into industry, academic, and government categories
```

### Timeline Format
Get chronological breakdowns:
```
/webresearch create a timeline of fusion energy breakthroughs in 2024
```

## Advanced Features

### Source-Specific Research
Focus on particular sources:
```
/webresearch find academic papers on machine learning from MIT and Stanford
```

### Statistical Analysis
Get data-driven insights:
```
/webresearch what are the key statistics on renewable energy adoption worldwide
```

### Comparative Analysis
Compare different topics or entities:
```
/webresearch compare the environmental impact of EVs vs hydrogen vehicles
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "tell me about AI", try "what are the latest developments in AI language models for medical diagnosis"

2. **Request Format**: Specify how you want the information presented:
   ```
   /webresearch explain quantum computing breakthroughs
   format as bullet points
   focus on practical applications
   ```

3. **Time-Sensitive Queries**: For news and current events, you can specify timeframes:
   ```
   /webresearch what happened in renewable energy this week
   ```

4. **Multi-Part Questions**: Break complex queries into connected parts:
   ```
   /webresearch analyze the chip manufacturing industry
   focus on: new facilities, major players, investment trends
   timeline: past 6 months
   ```

## Tips for Quality Results

- Use clear, specific questions
- Specify your preferred format (bullet points, categories, timeline)
- Indicate if you want academic, news, or business focus
- Mention time periods when relevant
- Request specific types of sources if needed
- Ask for comparisons or trends rather than just facts
- Specify the depth of analysis you want

## Limitations

- Cannot access private or paywalled content
- May have a slight delay in real-time events
- Best for factual research rather than opinion-based topics
- Sources are limited to publicly available information

## Example Use Cases

### Scientific Research
```
/webresearch what are the breakthrough discoveries in CRISPR gene editing
format results into:
- recent discoveries
- clinical applications
- upcoming trials
```

### Market Intelligence
```
/webresearch analyze the AI chip market
include:
- major players
- market share
- new developments
```

### Current Events Analysis
```
/webresearch what are the key climate policy changes
format as:
- new regulations
- country commitments
- industry response
```

### Technical Deep Dives
```
/webresearch explain advances in quantum error correction
focus on:
- new methods
- experimental results
- practical implications
```

Remember that the command can handle natural language queries, so feel free to ask questions as you would to a research assistant. The more specific and well-structured your query, the better the results will be.
