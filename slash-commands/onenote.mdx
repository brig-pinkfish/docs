## What can you do with it?

OneNote allows you to manage your digital notebooks programmatically through the Microsoft Graph API. You can create new pages in specific sections, update existing page content by appending or modifying notes, retrieve page content and metadata, delete pages you no longer need, and search across all your pages to find specific information. This integration is perfect for note-taking automation, knowledge management systems, meeting notes organization, and building applications that interact with OneNote notebooks.

## Notes 

Both PinkConnect and Paragon proxies are supported with different endpoint structures. Page content must be provided as valid HTML including DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags. The update action supports append, replace, and insert operations on different page elements. Search functionality looks through both page titles and content. Section IDs are required for creating pages - these can be obtained through the OneNote sections API.
