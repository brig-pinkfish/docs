The `/form-processing` command allows you to extract form fields and their values using a machine learning model specifically trained for this purpose. Over the last year, LLM models like Claude and OpenAI have eclipsed custom models like this. But every now and then, a custom trained model like this may have greater accuracy. So if you're struggling with a LLM to do document processing on scanned or PDF forms, give this a try.

## Basic Usage

Process a form by either uploading a file or providing a URL:

```
/form-processing
File: [Upload your form file]
```

or

```
/form-processing
URL: [URL to your form file]
```

## Input Formats

Supported file types include:
- PDF documents
- Scanned images (PNG, JPEG)
- Digital forms

## Output Format

The command returns a JSON object containing:

1. Field Extractions:
   - Field names and their extracted values
   - Confidence scores for each extraction
   - Field types (e.g., checkbox status, text fields)

2. Metadata:
   - Processing timestamp
   - File information
   - Model version

Example output:

```
{
    "json": {
        "PHARMACY": {
            "fieldValue": "filled_checkbox",
            "confidence": 0.9997177124023438
        },
        "Member ID Number": {
            "fieldValue": "871381692",
            "confidence": 0.9334482550621033
        },
        "Date of Birth:": {
            "fieldValue": "20-MARCH-1960",
            "confidence": 0.9115520119667053
        }
    },
    "table": []
}
```

## Understanding the Results

### Field Values
- Text fields: Contains the extracted text
- Checkboxes: Reports as either "filled_checkbox" or "unfilled_checkbox"
- Empty fields: May return "-" or be omitted

### Confidence Scores
- Range from 0 to 1 (0% to 100% confidence)
- Higher scores indicate greater confidence in the extraction
- Generally:
  - greater than 0.9: Very high confidence
  - 0.7-0.9: Good confidence
  - less than 0.7: Lower confidence, may need review

The Form Processing command provides a reliable way to extract data from structured forms. While newer LLM models have broader capabilities, this specialized tool can still outperform them for specific form processing tasks.
