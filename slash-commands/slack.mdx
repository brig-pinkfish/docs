## Notes 

Slack uses unique IDs for users (starting with U), channels (starting with C), and teams (starting with T). You can reference channels by ID or name with # prefix. Direct messages create a special channel between users. Message timestamps are in Unix format with microsecond precision. Scheduled messages use Unix timestamps for the post_at parameter. The integration can only access public channels that the bot has been added to. Message filtering with keywords is done client-side after retrieving messages. Rich text formatting is supported through blocks in message responses.
