## Notes 

When creating tasks, use WhoId for contacts and leads, and WhatId for other objects. PATCH updates return empty responses on success, so avoid mixing PATCH operations with other actions. For case creation, the system will first attempt to find existing contacts by email; if not found, it will use the Supplied fields instead. All SOQL queries must be properly encoded using encodeURIComponent().
