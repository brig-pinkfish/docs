## Notes 

Keap uses numeric IDs for both companies and contacts. Email addresses are stored as arrays with field identifiers like "EMAIL1". Phone numbers include type categories such as Work, Mobile, or Home. Address information is stored as structured objects with separate fields for each component. When updating records, only provide the fields you want to change - other fields will remain unchanged. The system supports multiple email addresses and phone numbers per contact.
