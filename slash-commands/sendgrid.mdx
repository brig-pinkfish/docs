## Notes 

All emails return HTTP 202 status for successful acceptance into the delivery queue. Content types include "text/plain" and "text/html". Attachments must be base64 encoded. Scheduled emails use Unix timestamps for send_at parameter. Template IDs start with "d-" prefix for dynamic templates. Sender verification is required for "from" addresses. Supports both PinkConnect and Paragon proxy connections. Personalizations allow dynamic content insertion in templates. File attachments support various MIME types including application/pdf, image/jpeg, and application/octet-stream.
