## Notes 

Jira uses structured document format for descriptions with type "doc" and nested content arrays. Issue types include Bug, Task, Story, Epic, and custom types defined in your instance. Priority IDs are numeric: 1=Highest, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low, 5=Lowest. JQL (Jira Query Language) supports complex searches with operators like AND, OR, and functions like currentUser(). Assignment requires a two-step process: first finding the user's account ID by email, then assigning using the account ID. All timestamps use ISO 8601 format.
