## JQL Examples

Common JQL queries:
- `assignee = currentUser()` - Your issues
- `status = "In Progress"` - By status
- `priority = High` - By priority
- `created >= -7d` - Last 7 days
- `project = PROJ AND status = "To Do"` - Combined filters

## Issue Types

Common types:
- **Bug**: Software defects
- **Task**: General work items
- **Story**: User stories
- **Epic**: Large features
- **Sub-task**: Part of larger issue

## Tips
- Use project keys (e.g., PROJ) not full names
- Priorities: 1=Highest, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low, 5=Lowest
- JQL is case-insensitive for operators
- Email addresses automatically resolve to account IDs
