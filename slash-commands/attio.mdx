# Attio

Attio is a data-driven customer relationship platform that allows users to manage their contacts, lists, and data workflows with programmatic access to core platform features.

## Overview

The Attio skill provides functionality for:
- Managing customer relationship data
- Working with lists and objects (people and companies)
- Organizing contacts and data workflows
- Accessing workspace information
- Handling CRM data programmatically

## Connection Requirements

This skill requires an Attio connection configured through:
- **PinkConnect Proxy**: PC_BASE_URL (equivalent to https://api.attio.com/v2)
- **Authentication**: Handled automatically by the proxy
- **API Version**: Uses Attio API v2

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// List all lists in workspace
GET: lists

// List all objects in workspace
GET: objects
```

## Key Features

### List Management
- **List Retrieval**: Get all lists in the workspace
- **List Organization**: Manage different types of data lists
- **Pagination Support**: Handle large datasets with pagination
- **List Metadata**: Access list creation dates and properties

### Object Management
- **Object Types**: Work with different object types (people, companies)
- **Object Properties**: Access object metadata and structure
- **API Slugs**: Use API-friendly object identifiers
- **Workspace Context**: All operations scoped to workspace

## Common Operations

### List All Lists
```javascript
GET: lists
```

### List All Objects
```javascript
GET: objects
```

## Response Structures

### Lists Response
```javascript
{
  "output": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "016f46b1-c878-41ab-b62a-83443b7cec75",
        "type": "list",
        "name": "All Accounts",
        "created_at": "2023-01-26T14:47:04.999Z"
      }
    ],
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

### Objects Response
```javascript
{
  "output": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": {
          "workspace_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
          "object_id": "people"
        },
        "type": "object",
        "api_slug": "people",
        "singular_noun": "person",
        "plural_noun": "people"
      }
    ],
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## Data Structure

### List Properties
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the list
- **Type**: Always "list" for list objects
- **Name**: Human-readable list name
- **Created At**: Timestamp of list creation

### Object Properties
- **ID**: Composite identifier with workspace_id and object_id
- **Type**: Always "object" for object types
- **API Slug**: API-friendly identifier (e.g., "people", "companies")
- **Singular Noun**: Singular form of the object name
- **Plural Noun**: Plural form of the object name

## Pagination

### Pagination Parameters
- **offset**: Starting position for results (default: 0)
- **limit**: Maximum number of results per page (default: 20)
- **total**: Total number of available records

### Handling Pagination
```javascript
// First page
GET: lists?offset=0&limit=20

// Next page
GET: lists?offset=20&limit=20
```

## Object Types

### Common Objects
- **people**: Individual contacts and persons
- **companies**: Organizations and businesses
- **Custom Objects**: Workspace-specific object types

### Object Identification
- Use `api_slug` for API operations
- Use `singular_noun` and `plural_noun` for display purposes
- Reference objects by their composite ID structure

## Workspace Context

### Workspace Scope
- All operations are scoped to the authenticated workspace
- Workspace ID is included in object identifiers
- Lists and objects are workspace-specific

### Data Organization
- Lists contain collections of objects
- Objects define the structure of data types
- Relationships between objects can be managed through lists

## Important Notes

- **API Version**: Uses Attio API v2 through PinkConnect proxy
- **Authentication**: Handled automatically by proxy connection
- **Rate Limits**: Respect Attio API rate limits for high-volume operations
- **Pagination**: Use pagination for large datasets to avoid timeouts
- **Workspace Isolation**: Data is isolated by workspace boundaries

## Best Practices

1. **Pagination**: Always handle pagination for list operations
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API calls
3. **Object Identification**: Use api_slug for consistent object references
4. **Data Validation**: Validate object types before performing operations
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate delays between API calls
6. **Workspace Awareness**: Understand workspace context for data operations
7. **List Organization**: Use descriptive list names for better data management
8. **Performance**: Cache object metadata to reduce API calls
