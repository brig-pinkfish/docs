## What can you do with it?

The Attio integration provides access to your data-driven customer relationship platform, allowing you to manage contacts, lists, and data workflows programmatically. You can retrieve all lists in your workspace, access object definitions including people and companies, and work with the structured data that powers Attio's relationship management capabilities. This integration is perfect for teams that need to integrate their CRM data with other business processes and automate data workflows.

## Notes 

Attio uses UUID-based identifiers for lists and workspace-scoped IDs for objects. All responses include pagination metadata with offset, limit, and total counts. Objects have both singular and plural noun forms for proper API usage. Lists are identified by UUID and include creation timestamps. The system supports standard pagination with configurable offset and limit parameters for efficient data retrieval.
