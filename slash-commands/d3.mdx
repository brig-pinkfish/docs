Remember that D3 can handle various data formats and can create both simple and complex visualizations. The key is to be clear about your data and visualization goals in your command.

## Saving and Sharing Your D3 Charts

You can save and share your D3 visualizations in two simple steps:

1. First, create your visualization in one step.

2. Then, save it to [global file storage](/slash-commands/filestorage) in a subsequent step.

The /filestorage command will return a shareable link that you can send to colleagues. They can view and interact with your visualization directly through this link, making it easy to:
- Include visualizations in presentations
- Share insights with stakeholders
- Embed charts in internal documentation
- Archive important analytical views
- Collaborate on data analysis

Pro tip: Add descriptive names when saving your visualizations to make them easier to find and understand later.
