## Basic Scraping

Start a scraping session with the `/scraper` command followed by one or more URLs:

```
/scraper
url: https://example.com, https://example2.com
format: markdown
```

### Format Options

- `format: markdown` - Returns content in readable text format (default)
- `format: html` - Returns HTML content

### Content Filtering

- `include: article, .main-content, #content` - Specify elements to include
- `exclude: nav, .sidebar, #footer` - Specify elements to exclude
- `mainContent: false` - Include all content (default is true, which focuses on main content)

## Available Actions

Use actions when you need to navigate to a certain location before doing your scrape. Vision is a bit of an outlier in the action list b/c it's an altnerate method of scraping (versus a navigation action).

**Action Types**

1. **Navigation Actions**

   - `goTo: [URL]` - Navigate to a specific page
   - `wait: [milliseconds]` - Pause for specified time
   - `scrollBottom` - Scroll to bottom of page
   - `scrollTo: [selector]` - Scroll to specific element

2. **Interactive Actions**

   - `click: [text or selector]` - Click on an element
   - `hover: [text or selector]` - Move mouse over element
   - `fill: [field] with [text]` - Enter text into input field
   - `select: [option]` - Choose from dropdown menu
   - `check: [checkbox]` - Toggle checkbox/radio button
   - `press: [key]` - Press keyboard key (Enter, Tab, etc.)

3. **Advanced Actions**
   - `screenshot: [full page or selector]` - Capture screenshot
   - `vision: [prompt]` - Use AI to analyze page content
   - `runcode: [Playwright code]` - Execute custom PW code
   - `loop: [actions]` - Repeat actions with different inputs

### Waiting

Waiting between actions is a common pattern in scraping and often necessary. You can use the `wait` action to pause for a specified amount of time. So if something isn't working, try adding a wait in between actions.

### Examples

**Basic Navigation:**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://example.com
wait: 2000
click: "Accept Cookies"
scrollBottom
screenshot: full page
```

**Form Filling:**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://login.example.com
fill: Username with "myuser"
fill: Password with "mypass"
click: "Login"
wait: 1000
screenshot
```

**Working with Lists:**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://shop.example.com
select: "Sort by Price"
wait: 500
vision: "Extract all product prices as a table"
```

**Loop Example:**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://shop.example.com
loop:
  - click: "Add to Cart" in .product-card
  - wait: 1000
  items: product1, product2, product3
```

## Advanced Features

### Parent Scoping

Specify a parent container to narrow down element selection:

```
/scraper
click: "Submit" in .form-container
```

### AI Vision

Use Vision AI to extract specific information:

```
/scraper
goTo: https://shop.example.com
vision: "Find all products under $50 and list their features"
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple pages at once:

```
/scraper
urls:
  - https://example.com/page1
  - https://example.com/page2
format: markdown
wait: 1000
screenshot: full page
```

## Common Examples

1. **Login and Extract Content**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://www.example.com
fill: Username with "user123"
fill: Password with "pass123"
click: "Login"
wait: 2000
analyze: "Extract main dashboard statistics"
```

2. **Shopping Cart Process**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://shop.example.com
select: "Sort by Price: Low to High"
wait: 1000
click: "Add to Cart" in .first-product
click: "Checkout"
screenshot: full page
```

3. **Content Analysis**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://blog.example.com
scrollBottom
vision: "Summarize the main points of the article"
screenshot
```

4. **Form Submission**

```
/scraper
goTo: https://forms.example.com
fill: Name with "John Doe"
fill: Email with "john@example.com"
check: "Accept Terms"
click: "Submit"
wait: 2000
screenshot
```

## Selector Types

When targeting elements on a page, you can use several different methods:

1. **By Text Content**

   - `click: "Login"` - Clicks element containing exact text "Login"
   - `click: "Sign up for free"` - Works with longer phrases too

2. **By Placeholder Text**

   - `fill: "Search..." with "laptops"` - Targets input field with placeholder text
   - `click: "Enter your username"` - Works with any placeholder text

3. **CSS Selectors**

   - `click: #login-button` - Using ID (#)
   - `click: .submit-btn` - Using class name (.)
   - `click: button.primary` - Element type with class
   - `click: .form > .submit` - Using hierarchy
   - `click: [data-testid="submit"]` - Using attributes

4. **XPath Selectors**

   - `click: //button[@type="submit"]` - Button with specific type
   - `click: //div[@class="menu"]//a` - Links within menu div
   - `click: //h1[contains(text(), "Welcome")]` - Heading containing text
   - `click: //label[text()="Password"]/following-sibling::input` - Input field after label
   - `click: //*[@id="main"]//button[2]` - Second button in main container

5. **Combined Approaches**
   - `click: "Submit" in .form-container` - Text within specific container
   - `click: "Login" in #auth-modal` - Text within ID
   - `hover: "Menu" in .nav-bar` - Combining text and class
   - `click: "Next" in //div[@class="pagination"]` - Text within XPath-selected container

Remember:

- Text matching is case-sensitive
- For elements with spaces in selectors, use quotes: `".main content"`
- When using text, prefer exact matches over partial ones
- CSS selectors provide simple targeting for basic needs
- XPath provides more powerful selection capabilities:
  - Can traverse up the DOM tree
  - Can select elements based on their contents
  - Supports complex relationships between elements
- Always try to use the most specific selector that works

Happy scraping!
