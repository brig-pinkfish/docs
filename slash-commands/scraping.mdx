## Single Page Scraping

Extract data from specific webpage(s) using the `/Scrape single web page` command.

### Usage

```
/Scrape single web page [URL]
```

### Format Options

Choose one or more output formats:

- `markdown`: Returns content in Markdown format
- `links`: Extracts all hyperlinks from the page
- `html`: Provides processed HTML content
- `rawHtml`: Delivers unprocessed HTML content
- `screenshot`: Captures page screenshot

### Content Filtering Options

- `includeTags`: Specify HTML tags, classes, and IDs to include

  ```
  /Scrape single web page https://example.com includeTags=["article", ".main-content", "#content"]
  ```

- `excludeTags`: Specify HTML tags, classes, and IDs to exclude

  ```
  /Scrape single web page https://example.com excludeTags=["nav", ".sidebar", "#footer"]
  ```

- `onlyMainContent`: Focus on main content (default: true)

  ```

### Page Interaction Options

- `waitFor`: Time in milliseconds to wait before scraping
  ```

  ```

## Page Scraping with Screenshot

Capture both page content and screenshots using the `/Scrape page and take screenshot` command.

### Usage

```
/Scrape page and take screenshot [URL]
```

### Available Actions

```javascript
[
  { type: "wait", milliseconds: 2000 },
  { type: "click", selector: "button.search" },
  { type: "write", text: "search term" },
  { type: "press", key: "ENTER" },
  { type: "screenshot", fullPage: true },
];
```

### Example with Multiple Actions

```
/Scrape page and take screenshot https://example.com actions=[
  {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title='Search']"},
  {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 1000},
  {"type": "write", "text": "example search"},
  {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 1000},
  {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
  {"type": "screenshot", "fullPage": true}
]
```

## Website Crawling

Automatically navigate and collect data from multiple pages using the `/Crawl multiple web pages` command.

### Usage

```
/Crawl multiple web pages [Starting URL]
```

### Options

- `limit`: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: 20)
- `maxDepth`: Maximum depth of crawling (default: 10)
- `excludePaths`: Array of paths to exclude from crawling
- `includePaths`: Array of paths to include in crawling
- `scrapeOptions`: All options available in single page scraping

## Crawl Mapping

Generate a complete map of URLs from a website using the `/Prepare crawl map` command. This is particularly useful when you need to:

- Get an overview of a website's structure
- Find pages related to a specific topic
- Plan targeted scraping operations

### Usage

```
/Prepare crawl map [Starting URL]
```

### Options

- `includeSubdomains`: Include/exclude subdomains in the mapping (default: true)

  ```
  /Prepare crawl map https://example.com includeSubdomains=false
  ```

- `ignoreSitemap`: Skip the sitemap during mapping (default: false)

  ```
  /Prepare crawl map https://example.com ignoreSitemap=true
  ```

- `search`: Filter URLs by a search term
  ```
  /Prepare crawl map https://example.com search="products"
  ```

### Response Format

The command returns a JSON response with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "links": [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://example.com/about",
    "https://example.com/products",
    "https://example.com/blog",
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Pre-Scraping Analysis**

   ```
   /Prepare crawl map https://example.com
   ```

   Get a complete map of the site before deciding which pages to scrape.

2. **Topic-Specific Mapping**

   ```
   /Prepare crawl map https://example.com search="pricing"
   ```

   Find all pages related to pricing or specific topics.

3. **Main Domain Focus**

   ```
   /Prepare crawl map https://example.com includeSubdomains=false
   ```

   Map only the main domain, excluding subdomains.

4. **Custom Crawl Planning**
   ```
   /Prepare crawl map https://example.com ignoreSitemap=true
   ```
   Generate a map by crawling rather than using the sitemap.

### Tips for Effective Mapping

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with default settings to get a complete picture
2. **Use Search**: Narrow down results with specific search terms
3. **Optimize Performance**: Disable subdomain inclusion for faster mapping of large sites
4. **Combine with Scraping**: Use the map results to plan targeted scraping operations

Happy scraping!
