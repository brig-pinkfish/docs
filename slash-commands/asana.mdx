## What can you do with it?

The Asana integration enables comprehensive project management including workspaces, projects, and tasks. You can list all workspaces, retrieve projects within workspaces, create new tasks with assignments and due dates, query tasks with filtering options, and update task status. This integration is perfect for teams looking to automate their project workflows, track task progress, and maintain organized project structures across multiple workspaces.

## Notes 

Asana uses string-based GIDs (Global IDs) for all resources including workspaces, projects, and tasks. User identification can be done using "me", an email address, or a user GID. Tasks can be assigned to multiple projects simultaneously. Due dates should be provided in YYYY-MM-DD format. When querying tasks, you can filter by completion status and assignee to narrow down results. All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format.
