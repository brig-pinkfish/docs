## What can you do with it?

## Notes 

Asana uses string-based GIDs (Global IDs) for all resources including workspaces, projects, and tasks. User identification can be done using "me", an email address, or a user GID. Tasks can be assigned to multiple projects simultaneously. Due dates should be provided in YYYY-MM-DD format. When querying tasks, you can filter by completion status and assignee to narrow down results. All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format.
