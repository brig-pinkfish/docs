## What can you do with it?

The `/image-edit` command enables you to generate and edit images using the premium Nano Banana model. You can create new images from text descriptions, modify existing images through natural language instructions, add or remove elements, change styles, improve typography, enhance compositions, and create sophisticated image generations with professional-grade results.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/image-edit [instruction]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `prompt` - Text description of what you want to generate, or instruction on how to edit the given image
- `input_image` - Image to edit (URL or uploaded file). Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp

**Optional:**
- `aspect_ratio` - Aspect ratio: "match_input_image", "1:1", "16:9", "9:16", "4:3", "3:4", "3:2", "2:3", "4:5", "5:4", "21:9", "9:21", "2:1", "1:2" (defaults to "match_input_image")
- `prompt_upsampling` - Automatic prompt improvement (boolean, defaults to false)
- `seed` - Random seed for reproducible generation (integer, optional)
- `output_format` - Output format: "jpg", "png" (defaults to "png")
- `safety_tolerance` - Safety tolerance: 0-6 (defaults to 2). 0 is most strict, 6 is most permissive. Max 2 when input images are used
- `fileLinksExpireInDays` - How long generated files remain accessible: 1-7 days (defaults to 7)
- `fileLinksExpireInMinutes` - How long generated files remain accessible in minutes (takes precedence over days)

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json

  "output": [
    {
      "url": "https://generated-file-url",
      "mimeType": "image/png"
