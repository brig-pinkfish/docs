## What can you do with it?

The `/image-edit` command enables image-to-image regeneration using the premium Nano Banana model. By providing an input image and text instructions, you can regenerate the image with modifications, transformations, style changes, and enhancements. This is a generative process that creates new images based on your input image and prompts, rather than traditional pixel-level editing.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/image-edit [instruction]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `prompt` - Text description of what you want to generate, or instruction on how to edit the given image
- `input_image` - Image to edit (URL or uploaded file). Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp

**Optional:**
- `aspect_ratio` - Aspect ratio: "match_input_image", "1:1", "16:9", "9:16", "4:3", "3:4", "3:2", "2:3", "4:5", "5:4", "21:9", "9:21", "2:1", "1:2" (defaults to "match_input_image")
- `prompt_upsampling` - Automatic prompt improvement (boolean, defaults to false)
- `seed` - Random seed for reproducible generation (integer, optional)
- `output_format` - Output format: "jpg", "png" (defaults to "png")
- `safety_tolerance` - Safety tolerance: 0-6 (defaults to 2). 0 is most strict, 6 is most permissive. Max 2 when input images are used
- `fileLinksExpireInDays` - How long generated files remain accessible: 1-7 days (defaults to 7)
- `fileLinksExpireInMinutes` - How long generated files remain accessible in minutes (takes precedence over days)

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "output": [
    {
      "url": "https://generated-file-url",
      "mimeType": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** All edited images are automatically saved to your "Multimedia Artifact" file store and will be accessible for the duration specified by the `fileLinksExpireInDays` parameter.

### Notes

**Model Capabilities (Nano Banana):**
- Premium image-to-image regeneration with maximum performance
- Excellent typography generation and text integration
- Advanced object manipulation and removal through regeneration
- Professional-grade style transfers
- Precise color and lighting adjustments
- Complex scene transformations

**Key Features:**
- Generative image-to-image process (not pixel-level editing)
- Maintains aspect ratio of input images by default
- Advanced prompt upsampling for better results
- Reproducible results with seed control
- Professional safety filtering

**Best Practices:**
- Use specific, descriptive prompts for better results
- Enable prompt_upsampling for complex transformations
- Use PNG format for images requiring transparency
- Use JPG format for final output to reduce file size
- Lower safety_tolerance for more creative freedom (max 2 with input images)
- Understand this is regeneration, not traditional editing - results may vary

**Limitations:**
- Requires input image for all regeneration tasks
- This is a generative process, not precise pixel editing
- Safety tolerance is limited when using input images (max 2)
- Processing time varies based on regeneration complexity
- Results depend on input image quality and prompt clarity
