## What can you do with it?

Store, retrieve, update, and search data in a NoSQL datastore. Perfect for managing structured data with key-value pairs, metadata, and optional sorting capabilities. Ideal for user preferences, application state, dynamic content, and any data that needs persistent storage with search functionality.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/datastore [action] [key] [content]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `action` - Operation to perform (create, read, update, delete, search)

- `key` - Unique identifier for the item (required for most operations)

**Optional:**

- `content` - Data to store (required for create/update)

- `collection` - Collection ID for data isolation

- `sort field` - Secondary sorting field

- `metadata` - Additional custom attributes

- `search query` - Text to search for

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "item": {
    "id": "unique item ID",
    "key": "your key",
    "content": "stored data",
    "created": "timestamp",
    "modified": "timestamp"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "collection": "collection ID if used"
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/datastore
action: create
key: user123
content: {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
```
Store simple user data with a unique key.

### Advanced Usage
```
/datastore
action: search
search query: customer feedback
field: content
type: fuzzy
metadata.category: reviews
```
Search for items with fuzzy matching and metadata filters.

### Specific Use Case
```
/datastore
action: update
key: order456
content: {"status": "shipped", "tracking": "ABC123"}
trigger urls: {"https://webhook.site/notify": "api-key-123"}
```
Update order status and trigger external webhook notification.

### Notes

Items are uniquely identified by key + sortField combination. Use itemId for direct access to specific items. Search supports fuzzy, exact, and prefix matching. Triggers can notify external URLs on data changes. URL-encode keys and sortFields in API calls.
