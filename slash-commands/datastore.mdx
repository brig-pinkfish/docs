## Why Use a Data Store?

The data store provides a flexible way to organize and retrieve your data using a key + sort field system. Think of it like a smart filing cabinet where you can:

- **Organize Related Data**: Group similar items under the same key (like putting related files in the same folder)
- **Find Specific Items**: Quickly locate exact items using the sort field
- **Scale Easily**: Store multiple related items without creating complex folder structures
- **Share Selectively**: Control access to individual items or groups of items
- **View Data Your Way**: Display content as documents or tables based on your needs

### Common Use Cases

- Store all meeting notes under key `meeting-notes` with dates as sort fields
- Keep employee records under key `employees` with email addresses as sort fields
- Track inventory across categories using category names as sort fields
- Manage project documentation with project codes as sort fields
- Use as a [job queue](/how-to/job-queue)

## Basic Usage

The `/datastore` command lets you create, read, update, and delete items in the data store. After typing `/datastore`, you can specify your action and options in natural language.

## Key and Sort Field Fundamentals

### Important Rules

- The combination of `key` + `sortField` must be unique
- If you don't specify a `sortField`, one will be automatically generated for you
- You can have multiple items with the same `key` as long as they have different `sortField` values
- Think of `key` as a folder name and `sortField` as a unique identifier within that folder

### Real-World Example

Imagine managing employee reviews:

```
key: employee-reviews
sortField: [employee.email]
```

This structure lets you:

- Keep all reviews under one key
- Find a specific employee's review instantly
- Store multiple reviews for different employees
- Avoid duplicate reviews for the same employee
- Easily share specific reviews with managers

### Key and Sort Field Patterns

1. **Single Key Only (Auto-generated Sort Field)**

   ```
   key: meeting-notes
   ```

   - Sort field will be auto-generated
   - Good for: Quick storage when uniqueness isn't a concern
   - Example: Daily notes where exact retrieval isn't needed

2. **Key + Date Sort Field**

   ```
   key: meeting-notes
   sortField: 2024-03-15
   ```

   - Creates unique daily entries
   - Good for: Time-series data, daily logs
   - Example: Can't have two items with key "meeting-notes" and sortField "2024-03-15"

3. **Key + Email Sort Field**

   ```
   key: employee-reviews
   sortField: jane.smith@company.com
   ```

   - One record per employee
   - Good for: Per-user data
   - Example: Can't have duplicate reviews for the same email

4. **Key + Category Sort Field**

   ```
   key: inventory
   sortField: electronics-001
   ```

   - Unique identifier within category
   - Good for: Categorized items requiring unique IDs

5. **Key + ID Sort Field**
   ```
   key: customers
   sortField: CUST-001
   ```
   - Explicit unique identifiers
   - Good for: Systems requiring specific IDs

## Command Options

### Creating Items

Basic syntax:

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: [your-key]
sortField: [optional-sort-field]
content: [your-content]
metadata: [your-metadata]
viewerType: [table/document]
permissions: [array of permissions]
triggerUrls: [optional-trigger-urls]
```

### Available Options

#### Required Fields

- `key`: (Required) Primary identifier for your item. Think of it as a folder or category name.
  ```
  key: sales-reports
  ```

#### Optional Fields

- `sortField`: Secondary identifier that makes the item unique when combined with key

  ```
  sortField: 2024-Q1
  ```

- `content`: The main content of your item

  ```
  content: Q1 Sales Analysis
  ```

- `metadata`: Custom attributes as a JSON object

  ```
  metadata: {
    "region": "North America",
    "department": "Sales"
  }
  ```

  For tables:

  ```
  metadata: {
    "displayType": "csv",
    "csvData": "Month,Revenue,Units\nJan,50000,500\nFeb,55000,550"
  }
  ```

- `logoUrl`: URL for a logo to display in the viewer

  ```
  logoUrl: http://www.imgstore.com/myimg.jpg
  ```

- `permissions`: Array of view/edit permissions

  ```
  permissions: ["view"] // Read-only access
  permissions: ["view", "edit"] // Read and write access
  permissions: [] // Private
  ```

- `viewerType`: How the content should be displayed

  ```
  viewerType: "table" // For spreadsheet-like data
  viewerType: "document" // For document-style content
  ```

- `triggerUrls`: URLs to be called when the item changes
  ```
  triggerUrls: {
    "URL1": "APIKEY1"
  }
  ```

### About Triggers

Datastore items can have triggers attached that fire when the item is updated. When you attach a trigger URL to an item:

- The trigger will be called any time the item changes (content, metadata, or any other field)
- Each URL in the triggerUrls object will be called with its corresponding API key
- The trigger receives information about what changed in the item
- You can update items without firing triggers using the "trigger off" option

Example of creating an item with a trigger:

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: jobs
sortField: job-2024-03-15-001
content: Process monthly report
metadata: {
    "status": "not_started",
    "type": "report_generation"
}
triggerUrls: {
    "https://api.myservice.com/webhook": "my-api-key-123"
}
```

To update an item without firing triggers, use:

```
/datastore update item with trigger off:
key: jobs
sortField: job-2024-03-15-001
content: Updated content
```

## Real-World Examples

1. **Project Documentation**

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: projects
sortField: mobile-app-redesign
content: Mobile App Redesign Documentation
metadata: {
    "status": "in-progress",
    "team": "design"
}
permissions: ["view", "edit"]
viewerType: "document"
```

2. **Sales Reports by Region**

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: sales-data
sortField: europe-2024-q1
content: European Region Q1 Sales
metadata: {
    "displayType": "csv",
    "csvData": "Country,Revenue,Units\nFrance,75000,750\nGermany,82000,820"
}
viewerType: "table"
permissions: ["view"]
```

3. **Employee Training Records**

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: training-completion
sortField: alice.johnson@company.com
content: Security Training 2024
metadata: {
    "completionDate": "2024-03-15",
    "score": "95%"
}
```

4. **Product Inventory by Category**

```
/datastore create a new item with:
key: inventory
sortField: smartphones
content: Smartphone Inventory
metadata: {
    "displayType": "csv",
    "csvData": "Model,Stock,Price\niPhone 15,50,999\nPixel 8,30,899"
}
viewerType: "table"
permissions: ["view", "edit"]
```

## Managing Items

### Reading Items

By key only (returns all items with that key):

```
/datastore get items with key: projects
```

By key and sort field (returns specific item):

```
/datastore get item with key: projects and sortField: mobile-app-redesign
```

### Updating Items

```
/datastore update item with:
key: projects
sortField: mobile-app-redesign
content: Updated project documentation
```

### Deleting Items

```
/datastore delete item with key: projects and sortField: mobile-app-redesign
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keys**

   - Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., "projects", "employees")
   - Keep them simple and descriptive
   - Use consistent naming patterns

2. **Sort Fields**

   - Use dates for time-based organization (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Use emails for per-user data
   - Use IDs for unique records
   - Use categories for grouping related items

3. **Metadata**

   - Use for searchable attributes
   - Keep structure consistent within similar items
   - Avoid storing large amounts of data

4. **Permissions**

   - Use view-only when possible
   - Carefully consider who needs edit access
   - Review shared links periodically

5. **Triggers**
   - Use triggers for automation workflows
   - Consider using "trigger off" for maintenance updates
   - Keep track of your trigger URLs and API keys
   - Test trigger endpoints before adding them to production items
