## What can you do with it?

The Affinity integration allows you to access and manage your relationship intelligence data including lists, people, and custom field values. You can retrieve all accessible lists, get detailed field values for specific people, and access the structured data that powers Affinity's relationship management capabilities. This integration is ideal for teams that need to programmatically access their relationship data and integrate it with other business processes.

## How to use it?

```
/your-affinity-connection [action] [required-parameters] [optional-parameters]
```

## Notes 

Affinity uses numeric IDs for lists and people. Lists have a type field (0 for people lists) and can be public or private. Field values contain structured data that may include location information like city, state, country, and street address. The system tracks creation and update timestamps for all field values. Access is controlled by your Affinity permissions and you can only retrieve data for lists and people you have access to.
