---

The `/trigger-call` command allows you to start other workflows from within your current workflow. Think of it like a remote control that can start other automated processes. Perfect for:

- Chaining multiple workflows together
- Starting background processes
- Coordinating complex workflows
- Triggering dependent workflows
- Managing sequential workflow tasks

## Basic Usage

Start another workflow using the trigger command:

```
/trigger-call
Trigger URL: [Your workflow endpoint URL]
Trigger API Key: [Your API key]
```

## Required Parameters

- `Trigger URL`: The web address where your target workflow lives

  - Must be a valid URL
  - Should be the complete endpoint address
  - Usually provided in your workflow settings

- `Trigger API Key`: Your security key for accessing the workflow
  - Unique to your account
  - Required for authentication
  - Keep this private and secure

See [API Triggers documentation](/api-reference/introduction) for more information.

## Optional Parameters

### Execution Control

- `wait`: Controls whether to wait for the triggered workflow to complete
  - `true`: Wait for completion (default)
    - You'll get full results back
    - Sees the complete execution
    - Good for dependent processes
  - `false`: Don't wait (fire and forget)
    - Starts the workflow and moves on
    - Faster execution
    - Good for background tasks

## How It Works

### When Waiting for Results (wait: true)

1. Triggers the workflow
2. Waits for completion
3. Returns detailed results including:
   - Workflow details
   - Step-by-step results
   - Execution times
   - Success/failure status

### When Not Waiting (wait: false)

1. Triggers the workflow
2. Immediately returns a confirmation
3. Provides a Run ID for reference (in the header of the response)
4. Continues with your current workflow

## Example Commands

### Basic Trigger with Waiting

```
/trigger-call call
Trigger URL: https://your-workflow-endpoint.com
Trigger API Key: your-api-key-here
```

### Fire-and-Forget Trigger

```
/trigger-call call
Trigger URL: https://your-workflow-endpoint.com
Trigger API Key: your-api-key-here
wait: false
```

## Monitoring and Tracking

The Monitor interface provides a centralized view of all your trigger call executions. You can:

- Track the sequence of events across multiple workflows
- View the timing and duration of each triggered workflow
- Inspect the full execution chain when workflows trigger other workflows
- Debug issues by following the complete execution path
- Monitor the status of background tasks started with `wait: false`

## Important Considerations

### Avoiding Infinite Loops

Be cautious when implementing trigger calls to prevent infinite loops or excessive execution:

- Never create circular trigger dependencies where workflows trigger each other endlessly
- Implement safeguards like execution counters or time-based checks
- Consider using the datastore to track execution state and prevent loops
- Monitor your workflow usage to catch any unintended rapid triggering

### Building Job Queues

You can combine trigger calls with the datastore to create a job queue system. See [Job Queues](/how-to/job-queue) for more information.

### Storing your API Key as a secret

If you want to keep your API key out of your generated steps in plain text, you can store it as a secret in the datastore and then retrieve it at runtime. See [Secrets](/essentials/secrets) for more information. This approach would also allow you to rotate your API key without having to update your workflow.

The Trigger Calls command makes it easy to connect your workflows. Start with the basics and expand as needed!
