## What can you do with it?

The `/html-app` command enables you to create complete HTML applications with interactive functionality. You can build web interfaces, forms, dashboards, calculators, and single-page applications with modern styling and JavaScript interactivity, all generated as self-contained HTML files.

<Warning>
When you create an HTML app, you're limited to the output limit of the LLM, so if you ask for something very complicated, it may cut out before you're done. This skill is intended for simple web pages and dashboards, not complex web sites.
</Warning>

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/html-app [description]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `description` - Description of the HTML application you want to create

**Optional:**

- `features` - Specific features or functionality to include
- `style` - Visual style preferences (modern, minimal, colorful, etc.)
- `interactivity` - JavaScript behaviors and interactions needed

### Response Format

The command returns:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.3/css/bulma.min.css">
    <style>[Custom CSS]</style>
</head>
<body>
    [HTML content]
    <script>[JavaScript code]</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/html-app
description: create a simple todo list application
```
Generates a basic todo list app with add, delete, and mark complete functionality.

### Advanced Usage
```
/html-app
description: interactive expense tracker with categories
features: add expenses, categorize, calculate totals, show chart
style: modern and clean with blue accent colors
interactivity: form validation, dynamic updates, local storage
```
Creates a comprehensive expense tracking application with data visualization and persistence.

### Specific Use Case
```
/html-app
description: contact form with validation
features: name, email, message fields with submit button
style: professional business style
```
Builds a contact form with client-side validation and professional styling.

### Storing Your HTML Apps

A typical pattern is to save your generated HTML app to [File Storage](/slash-commands/filestorage) for persistent access and sharing. Generate the html app in one step and then save it in the next.

```
/selected-filestore create a new file with:
filename: my-dashboard.html
content: [HTML output from the previous step]
metadata: "Interactive dashboard"
file_links_expire_in_days: "never"
```

This allows you to:
- Access your HTML app after the automation completes
- Share the app via a public URL
- Build a library of reusable interfaces
- Version and update your apps over time

### Notes

**Technical Details:**
- Uses Bulma CSS framework for styling
- ES5-compatible JavaScript for broad browser support
- Self-contained HTML files (no external dependencies except CDN)
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

**Limitations:**
- Output limited to ~8000 tokens (complex apps will be simplified)
- Uses traditional JavaScript syntax (var, function declarations)
- No ES6+ features to ensure compatibility
- Single-file output only
