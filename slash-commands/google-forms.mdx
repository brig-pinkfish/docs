## What can you do with it?

Google Forms allows you to create and manage online forms programmatically. You can create new forms, add various types of questions (text, multiple choice, checkboxes, scales, dates), update existing forms, retrieve form responses, set up webhooks for real-time notifications, and manage form permissions. This integration is perfect for survey automation, feedback collection, and dynamic form generation. Note that listing all forms requires the Google Drive integration.

## Notes 

Form IDs and Item IDs are required for most operations and must be obtained from existing forms. To list all forms, use the Google Drive integration. Question types include text, paragraph text, multiple choice (radio/checkbox/dropdown), linear scale, date, time, and file upload. Form responses are returned with answers mapped to their corresponding item IDs.
