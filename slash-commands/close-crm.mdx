## Notes 

Close CRM uses string-based IDs with prefixes like "lead_", "contact_", "opportunity_", etc. Contact information is stored as arrays - emails and phones can have multiple entries per record. Custom fields use the format "cf_custom_field_id" and values are specific to your Close CRM configuration. Advanced search supports nested field queries like "emails.email" for searching within contact email arrays. Record creation for leads can include embedded contact information in a single request.
