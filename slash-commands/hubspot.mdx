## Notes 

When searching for contacts, you can use multiple filter groups with OR logic between groups and AND logic within groups. Deal stages and ticket priorities use specific HubSpot values that should match your portal configuration. Association type IDs are predefined: use typeId 3 for contact-to-deal associations and typeId 16 for contact-to-ticket associations. Properties can be specified multiple times in fetch operations for granular control over returned data.
