## Notes 

Presentation IDs can be extracted from Google Slides URLs using the pattern: /d/[PRESENTATION_ID]/. Coordinates use points (PT) as units where 72 PT equals 1 inch. The origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner. Object IDs must be unique within a presentation. Batch operations can be performed by grouping multiple requests together. Maximum request size is 10MB.
