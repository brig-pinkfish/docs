## Notes

LinkedIn uses URN (Uniform Resource Name) format for entity identification. Profile IDs are required for most operations and can be obtained from the get-profile endpoint. Company searches return organization URNs that can be used for posting and follower operations. Job postings require valid company IDs and location information. Connection data includes pagination for large contact lists.
