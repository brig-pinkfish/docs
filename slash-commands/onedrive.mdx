## What can you do with it?

OneDrive enables you to manage your cloud files and folders programmatically. You can list files and folders in any directory, search for specific files across your entire drive, upload new files or create folders, download files for viewing or processing, move and copy files between locations, share files with others through links or invitations, and access special folders like Desktop or Documents. This integration is perfect for file backup automation, document management workflows, content synchronization, and building applications that interact with cloud storage.

## Notes 

OneDrive uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for most operations. A PinkConnect connection ID is required for all operations. Files have a .file property with mimeType, while folders have a .folder property with childCount. Special folders like Desktop, Documents, and Photos can be accessed through specific endpoints. For Excel files, the content is already decoded and ready to save as .xlsx - CSV conversion requires saving the file first.
