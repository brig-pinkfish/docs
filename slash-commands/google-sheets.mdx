## Finding Spreadsheet IDs

To find a spreadsheet ID:
1. Open the spreadsheet in Google Sheets
2. Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SPREADSHEET_ID]/edit`
3. The ID is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`

**Tip**: Connect Google Drive for easier spreadsheet management without needing IDs.

## Tips
- Always specify the sheet name when working with data
- Use A1 notation for ranges (e.g., "A1:C10")
- The command will fetch sheet information automatically
- For large datasets, work with specific ranges rather than entire sheets
