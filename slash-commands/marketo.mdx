All responses include requestId for tracking and success boolean indicating operation status. Lead activities use nextPageToken for pagination when moreResult is true. Campaign types include trigger (real-time) and batch (scheduled). Custom objects support relationships with leads. Tokens enable dynamic content in campaigns. Activity type IDs map to specific Marketo activities like email opens, web visits, and form fills. Uses PinkConnect proxy connection. Lead fields support both standard and custom attributes. Programs organize campaigns and assets in hierarchical structures.
