## What can you do with it?

The `/browser-operator` command is an AI agent that autonomously performs browser automation based on natural language instructions. You describe what you want accomplished, and the AI agent makes independent decisions on how to navigate, click, fill forms, extract data, and download files - no code required.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure

```
/browser-operator
task: [Natural language description of what to do]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `task` - Natural language description of what to do

**Optional:**

- `model` - AI model to use (default: google/gemini-2.5-flash)
  - google/gemini-2.5-flash
  - google/gemini-2.5-pro
  - openai/gpt-4o
  - openai/gpt-4o-mini
  - anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
- `systemPrompt` - Custom instructions to give the AI agent specialized behavior or context
- `maxSteps` - Maximum number of browser actions the agent can perform (default: 30)
- `buildId` - Prefix used to name all output files including logs, downloads, and scraped data
- `disableCache` - Set to true to disable action caching (default: false, caching is enabled)
- `cacheDurationDays` - How long cached actions remain valid in days (default: 7 days, recommended: 30 for stable sites, 1 for frequently changing sites)
- `region` - Geographic region where the browser session runs (default: us-west-2)
- `proxies` - Enable residential proxies to improve anti-detection capabilities (default: false)
- `browserSettings` - Browser configuration options:
  - `viewport` - Browser window dimensions in pixels (default: 1920x1080)
  - `advancedStealth` - Enable advanced anti-detection features (default: false)
  - `blockAds` - Block advertisements for faster page loading (default: true)
  - `solveCaptchas` - Automatically solve CAPTCHA challenges (default: true)
  - `recordSession` - Record the session for replay and debugging (default: true)
- `collectionId` - Specify which collection to store output files in (defaults to Multimedia Artifact Collection if not specified)
- `filesToUpload` - Files to make available in the browser for upload operations, provided as an array of objects with `url` and `fileName` properties
- `useContextService` - ID of a saved browser login connection to use for authentication

### Response Format

Browser Operator returns immediately with session details while the automation runs in the background:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "bo-1730000000-abc123",
  "status": "queued",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-30T12:00:00Z",
  "logFileName": "browser-operator-abc-123.log",
  "collectionId": "collection-xyz-789",
  "buildId": "agent-1730000000"
}
```

When the command executes, you receive this response within ~200ms. Simultaneously, a live browser session launches in the Browser Operator tab where you can watch the AI agent work in real-time and view the execution log as it streams.

## Authentication

Browser Operator supports two methods for handling authentication:

### Using Stored Secrets from Vault

Select a stored secret from the slash command menu to retrieve login credentials from your vault:

```
/vault - select vault secret
/browser-operator
task: Navigate to https://example.com/login, fill username with {username} and password with {password}, click login, then navigate to dashboard and extract data
```

The secret values are automatically available in your task description.

### Using Browser Login Connections

Browser Login Connections store authenticated session details (not credentials) that you create by logging in through a live browser session. Once created, these saved sessions can be used with Browser Operator.

**To create a Browser Login Connection:**

1. Create a new browser connection in your Connections page
2. Authenticate through the live browser session
3. Complete any 2FA or CAPTCHA challenges
4. Save the connection

**To use with Browser Operator:**

Select your saved browser connection from the slash command menu, then specify your task. The browser session will automatically include your saved authentication state.

```
/select - browser operator login
/browser-operator
task: Navigate to https://example.com/dashboard, download the latest report
```

**Session Expiry:**
Browser login sessions expire based on the service's timeout settings (hours to months). If a "remember me" option exists, use it during initial authentication to extend session life. Re-authenticate through the connection when the session expires.
