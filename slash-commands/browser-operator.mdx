## What can you do with it?

The `/browser-operator` command is an AI agent that autonomously performs browser automation based on natural language instructions. You describe what you want accomplished, and the AI agent makes independent decisions on how to navigate, click, fill forms, extract data, and download files - no code required.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure

```
/browser-operator
task: [Natural language description of what to do]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `task` - Natural language description of what to do

**Optional:**

- `buildId` - Prefix for organized file naming
- `model` - AI model to use (default: google/gemini-2.5-flash)
- `maxSteps` - Maximum browser actions (default: 30)
- `disableCache` - Disable action caching (default: false)

## Examples

### Basic Data Extraction

```
/browser-operator
task: Go to https://example.com/products, extract all product names and prices, save as products.json
```

### Form Submission

```
/browser-operator
task: Navigate to https://example.com/contact, fill the form with name=John Doe, email=john@example.com, message=Test inquiry, then submit the form
```

### File Upload

```
/browser-operator
files: data.csv from my files
task: Navigate to https://example.com/upload, upload data.csv to the file input, click Submit
```

## Writing Good Tasks

Be specific and clear. Include:

1. Starting URL
2. What action to take
3. Which elements
4. Sample data to use
5. What to save and filename

**Good tasks:**

- "Navigate to https://example.com/products, extract product names and prices, save as products.json"
- "Go to https://example.com/contact, fill name=John Doe, email=john@example.com, then submit"

**Bad tasks:**

- "Get the data" (what data? from where?)
- "Fill the form" (which form? with what data?)

## What the Agent Can Do

- Navigate to URLs
- Click buttons, links, elements
- Fill form fields
- Extract and scrape data
- Take screenshots
- Scroll pages
- Wait for elements
- Select from file picker

## What the Agent Cannot Do

- Execute JavaScript code
- Read CSV/JSON files from disk
- Loop through datasets programmatically
- Parse file contents
- Use variables or bindingData

For these use cases, use `/wrap-playwright` instead.
