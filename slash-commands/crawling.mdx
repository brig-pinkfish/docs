## What can you do with it?

With Crawling, crawl a website to retrieve the contents of pages. Systematically extract content from multiple pages by following links, perfect for comprehensive data collection, documentation scraping, or content migration. Features configurable depth controls, path filtering, subdomain inclusion, and the ability to apply scraping options (formats, proxy, caching) to all crawled pages.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/crawling [urls] [limit]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `urls` - Array of starting URLs to crawl

**Optional Crawl Control:**

- `limit` - Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: 10)
- `maxDepth` - Max depth to crawl (legacy, converts to maxDiscoveryDepth)
- `maxDiscoveryDepth` - How many link levels deep to discover
- `allowBackwardLinks` - Allow external domains (legacy, converts to allowExternalLinks)
- `allowExternalLinks` - Crawl external domains
- `crawlEntireDomain` - Crawl entire domain, not just children of URL
- `allowSubdomains` - Include subdomains in crawl

**Path Filtering:**

- `includePaths` - Only crawl URLs matching these patterns (e.g., ["/blog/*"])
- `excludePaths` - Skip URLs matching these patterns (e.g., ["/admin/*"])

**Scrape Options (Applied to All Pages):**

- `scrapeOptions` - Object containing any scrape parameters:
  - `formats` - Output formats (["markdown", "html", "links", etc.])
  - `onlyMainContent` - Extract only main content
  - `proxy` - Proxy type ("basic", "stealth", "auto")
  - `maxAge` - Use cache if younger than this (milliseconds)
  - `location` - Location settings for geo-specific content
  - Any other scrape parameter

**File Storage:**

- `file_links_expire_in_days` - Days until file links expire
- `file_links_expire_in_minutes` - Alternative to days

### Notes

- Polls job to completion automatically
- Legacy parameters are auto-converted (maxDepth→maxDiscoveryDepth, allowBackwardLinks→allowExternalLinks)
- Screenshots are uploaded to storage and returned as file_urls
- Supports glob patterns for path filtering (e.g., "/docs/*", "/blog/*")
- All scrape parameters can be applied to crawled pages via scrapeOptions
- Each page crawled uses one credit
