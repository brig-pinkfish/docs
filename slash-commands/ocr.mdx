## What can you do with it?

The `/ocr` command enables you to extract text from images, PDFs, and scanned documents using optical character recognition. You can convert photos of text into editable content, digitize printed documents, extract text from PDF files, extract form data from scanned forms, and process images or PDFs containing text in various formats.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/ocr [file] [options]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `file` - The image, PDF, or scanned document to process (URL or uploaded file)

**Optional:**

- `languageHints` - Array of language codes for better OCR accuracy (e.g., ["en", "es"])
- `extractTextOnly` - When true (default), returns only the extracted text. When false, includes detailed OCR data like bounding boxes, word positions, page structure, and text annotations for precise layout analysis
