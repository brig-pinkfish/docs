## What can you do with it?

The `/ocr` command enables you to extract text from images, PDFs, and scanned documents using optical character recognition. You can convert photos of text into editable content, digitize printed documents, extract text from PDF files, extract form data from scanned forms, and process images or PDFs containing text in various formats.

**Important:** This OCR service is designed for high-scale text extraction without LLM parsing or structuring. It provides raw text output optimized for processing large volumes of documents efficiently. If you need OCR combined with intelligent parsing, structuring, or data extraction in a single step, consider using one of the LLM commands directly (like `/claude`, `/openai`, or `/gemini`) which can perform OCR and content analysis together, though with lower throughput capacity.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/ocr [file] [options]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `file` - The image, PDF, or scanned document to process (URL, uploaded file, or artifact)

**Optional:**

- `languageHints` - Array of language codes for better OCR accuracy (e.g., ["en", "es"])
- `extractTextOnly` - When true (default), returns only the extracted text. When false, includes detailed OCR data like bounding boxes, word positions, page structure, and text annotations for precise layout analysis
- `collectionId` - Specific collection ID to store results. If not provided, uses default MultimediaArtifact collection
- `async` - When true, processes files asynchronously in background. Automatically enabled for large files

            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Async Response (async: true OR file is big):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "capability": "ocr",
  "async": true,
  "collectionId": "collection-id-123_artifact",
  "responseId": "ocr-processing-queue-1757091370603-abc123",
  "status": "queued",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-06T16:56:10.604Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "inputFileName": "document.pdf",
      "outputFileName": "ocr_document.json",
      "fileId": "fileId123",
      "signedUrl": "https://skills.pinkfish.ai/files/collection-id-123/ocr_document.json?signed-key=dummy-key"
    }
  ],
  "totalPages": 3,
  "totalImages": 0,
  "forceAsync": false,
  "message": "OCR processing started in background. Results will be saved to file storage when complete."
}
```

**Note:** The `signedUrl` will be immediately available with a placeholder file that gets overwritten with OCR results when processing completes. The `status` can be "queued", "processing", "completed", or "failed". Large files are automatically processed asynchronously regardless of the `async` parameter setting.
