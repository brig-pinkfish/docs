## Connection Requirements

### PinkConnect Proxy
- Uses PC_BASE_URL endpoint
- Requires ResponsiveIO connection ID
- Standard API authentication
- Project and intake access permissions

## API Endpoints

### Project Endpoints
```javascript
// Get specific project
GET /rfpserver/ext/v1/projects/{projectId}

// List projects (if available)
GET /rfpserver/ext/v1/projects

// Update project (if available)
PUT /rfpserver/ext/v1/projects/{projectId}
```

### Intake Endpoints
```javascript
// Get specific intake
GET /rfpserver/ext/v1/intakes/{intakeId}

// List intakes (if available)
GET /rfpserver/ext/v1/intakes

// Update intake (if available)
PUT /rfpserver/ext/v1/intakes/{intakeId}
```
