## Why Use OpenAI?

The `/openai` command gives you access to OpenAI's models. Perfect for:

- Natural language processing
- Content generation
- Data analysis
- Problem-solving
- Creative writing
- Tool selection 

## Basic Usage

Simply use the command followed by your query:

```
/openai Analyze market trends in the renewable energy sector
with file market_data.csv
```

You can also provide multiple documents:

```
/openai Compare Q4 performance across regions
with file q4_north.csv
with file q4_south.csv
```

Or no documents at all:

```
/openai Compare nano and micro-nano batteries
```

## Model Selection

You can specify which OpenAI model you want to use:

```
/openai use gpt-4o-mini
Convert the following text to a json format:
[text]
```

See most recent open AI documentation for available models.
See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

## Tool Selection (advanced)

Most LLMs support the concept of tools - which is a way to prepare an API call to external functions. We support this in the `/openai` command. It can be handy espcially when calling external APIs or when you want to call an automation that you've put behind a Pinkfish API endpoint.

See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling

```
/openai What's the current weather in Copenhagen in farenheight? 
"tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "getWeather",
        "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City name or coordinates"
            },
            "units": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
              "description": "Temperature units"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  Tool choice: [auto]
```

Sample response: 
```json
{
    "output": {
        "tool_calls": [
            {
                "id": "call_QEXgadie2OaO7o6Te26E1qOl",
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "getWeather",
                    "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Copenhagen\",\"units\":\"fahrenheit\"}"
                }
            }
        ],
        "content": null
    }
}
```

### Tool Choice Options

You can control how tools are used with `tool_choices`:

```
/openai Analyze market data
tool_choices = ["auto"]  // Let the model choose which tools to use
with file market_data.csv
```

```
/openai Analyze market data
tool_choices = ["none"]  // Prevent the model from using any tools
with file market_data.csv
```

```
/openai What's the weather?
tools = [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
tool_choices = [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather"}}]  // Force use of specific tool
```
