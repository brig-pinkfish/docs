## Why Use OpenAI?

The `/openai` command gives you access to OpenAI's models. Perfect for:

- Natural language processing
- Content generation
- Data analysis
- Problem-solving
- Creative writing

## Basic Usage

Simply use the command followed by your query:

```
/openai Analyze market trends in the renewable energy sector
with file market_data.csv
```

You can also provide multiple documents:

```
/openai Compare Q4 performance across regions
with file q4_north.csv
with file q4_south.csv
```

## Model Selection

You can specify which OpenAI model you want to use:

```
/openai use gpt-4o-mini
Give me back the following information in a json format:
name - john Does
address - 123 Main St
account - 1234567890
```

See most recent open AI documentation for available models.
See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

## Tool Selection

You can specify tools and how they should be used. 
See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling

```
/openai What's the weather in San Francisco?
tools = [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Tool Choice Options

You can control how tools are used with `tool_choices`:

```
/openai Analyze market data
tool_choices = ["auto"]  // Let the model choose which tools to use
with file market_data.csv
```

```
/openai Analyze market data
tool_choices = ["none"]  // Prevent the model from using any tools
with file market_data.csv
```

```
/openai What's the weather?
tools = [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
tool_choices = [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather"}}]  // Force use of specific tool
```
