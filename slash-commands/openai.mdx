## What can you do with it?

Use OpenAI models for general reasoning, chat, multimodal tasks, and advanced coding. Choose from various GPT models optimized for different performance and cost requirements.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/openai [prompt] [optional-parameters]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `prompt` - Your instructions or questions

**Optional:**

- `model` - Specific GPT model to use (defaults to gpt-4.1)

- `system prompt` - Override the default system prompt

- `files` - File URLs to include in the request

- `tools` - Function tools for the model to use

- `tool choices` - Control how the model uses tools

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "response": "Model's generated response",
  "format": "Response format (JSON/plaintext/markdown/HTML)",
  "metadata": {
    "model": "Model used",
    "tokens": "Token count"
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/openai
prompt: Create a marketing strategy for a new product launch
```
Get a response from GPT for strategic planning and creative tasks.

### Advanced Usage
```
/openai
prompt: Analyze this code and suggest optimizations
files: code_file.py
model: gpt-4.1
```
Use a specific model with file context for code analysis and optimization.

### Specific Use Case
```
/openai
prompt: Summarize these customer reviews
model: gpt-4o-mini
```
Fast, cost-effective analysis using the mini model for simple tasks.

### Notes

Available models: gpt-4o (general reasoning, chat, multimodal), gpt-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective chat, analysis), gpt-4.1 (advanced coding, long context - default), gpt-4.1-mini (fast coding, scalable tasks), gpt-4.1-nano (ultra-fast, simple tasks).

## Supported Models

Choose the appropriate OpenAI model based on your specific needs:

- **`gpt-4o`** - General reasoning, chat, multimodal tasks
- **`gpt-4o-mini`** - Fast, cost-effective chat and analysis
- **`gpt-4.1`** (default) - Advanced coding with long context support
- **`gpt-4.1-mini`** - Fast coding for scalable tasks
- **`gpt-4.1-nano`** - Ultra-fast processing for simple tasks
