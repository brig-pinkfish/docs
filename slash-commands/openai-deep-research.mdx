## What can you do with it?

The `/openai-deep-research` command provides advanced deep research capabilities using OpenAI's reasoning models with integrated web search. Perfect for comprehensive analysis, investigation, and research tasks that require extensive reasoning and web-based information gathering. This service processes requests asynchronously and can take 5-30 minutes to complete thorough research.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/openai-deep-research [research topic or question] [model] [reasoning effort] [files]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `research topic` - The topic, question, or prompt you want researched
- `model` - Choose between o3-deep-research (advanced) or o4-mini-deep-research (faster)

**Optional:**

- `reasoning effort` - Control reasoning intensity: minimal, low, medium, high (default: medium)
- `files` - Any files to include in the research analysis
- `output filename` - Custom name for the research report
- `trigger urls` - Webhook URLs to call when research completes

### Response Format

The command returns immediate confirmation with a response ID:
```json
{
  "responseId": "resp_68a1f5019d70819fa2195a6850d4194800b2bfd0a695ae47",
  "status": "queued",
  "message": "Process started. Once completed, you can see the result in the \"Multimedia Artifact\" file storage collection",
  "outputFileName": "openai-deep-research-result-{topic}.txt"
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Research
```
/openai-deep-research
research topic: Impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare industry trends 2024-2025
model: o3-deep-research
reasoning effort: medium
```
Conducts comprehensive research on AI healthcare trends with medium reasoning effort.

### Fast Research with Files
```
/openai-deep-research
research topic: Analyze this market report and compare with current industry data
model: o4-mini-deep-research
reasoning effort: low
files: market-report-q4.pdf
```
Quick analysis of provided files with current web data using faster model.

### Advanced Research with Triggers
```
/openai-deep-research
research topic: Comprehensive analysis of renewable energy investment opportunities in emerging markets
model: o3-deep-research
reasoning effort: high
output filename: renewable-energy-investment-analysis
trigger urls: https://yourapp.com/webhook
```
Deep research with maximum reasoning effort and webhook notification when complete.

## Model Options

### o3-deep-research
- **Best for**: Advanced reasoning, comprehensive deep research tasks
- **Processing time**: 10-30 minutes
- **Quality**: Highest reasoning and analysis depth

### o4-mini-deep-research
- **Best for**: Fast, cost-effective deep research
- **Processing time**: 5-15 minutes
- **Quality**: Good reasoning with faster results

## Key Features

### Web Search Integration
Automatically searches current web information to supplement research with up-to-date data and multiple sources.

### File Analysis
Upload documents, reports, or data files to be analyzed alongside web research for comprehensive insights.

### Asynchronous Processing
Research runs in the background, allowing you to continue other work while analysis completes.

### Artifact Storage
Results are automatically saved to your "Multimedia Artifact" file storage collection for easy access and sharing.

### Reasoning Control
Adjust the reasoning effort level to balance between thoroughness and speed based on your needs.

## Notes

- **Processing time**: Research typically takes 5-30 minutes depending on complexity and model choice
- **Results location**: All research reports are saved to the "Multimedia Artifact" file storage collection
- **Web search**: Always includes current web search data using web_search_preview tool
- **Status checking**: Use the responseId to check research progress, though polling is not recommended
- **Best practice**: Use trigger URLs for workflow automation when research completes
- **File handling**: Files are analyzed directly - no need to extract content beforehand
