## What can you do with it?

Call workflow triggers via API to execute workflows programmatically. Supports both synchronous (wait for results) and asynchronous (fire-and-forget) execution modes.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/trigger-call
url: trigger endpoint URL
api key: your authentication key
payload: data to send
```

### Parameters
- **url**: The trigger endpoint URL (required)
- **api key**: Your API authentication key (required)
- **payload**: JSON data to send to the trigger
- **wait** (optional): Wait for completion (true) or fire-and-forget (false)
- **headers** (optional): Additional custom headers

### File Attachments

API triggers support file attachments using `multipart/form-data`. When using the trigger-call command, you can include file attachments in your request. Attachments are stored in S3 and made available to your workflow via signed URLs in the inputs.

**Limits:**
- Maximum 25MB per file
- Maximum 100MB total across all attachments
- Maximum 20 files per request
- Executable files and scripts are blocked for security

**Note**: File attachments are only supported for API triggers (not webhook triggers).

### Response Format
With wait=true: Returns complete execution results including all step outputs and logs.
With wait=false: Returns immediately with run ID in headers.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
Simple trigger call:
```
/trigger-call
url: https://api.example.com/trigger/abc123
api key: your-api-key-here
payload: {"action": "process", "id": 12345}
```

### Advanced Usage
Synchronous call with custom data:
```
/trigger-call
url: https://api.example.com/automation/xyz789
api key: secret-key
wait: true
payload: {"customer": "john@example.com", "operation": "update", "data": {"status": "active"}}
```

### Specific Use Case
Fire-and-forget notification:
```
/trigger-call
url: https://api.example.com/notify
api key: notification-key
wait: false
payload: {"message": "Task completed", "priority": "high"}
```

### Notes
- Run ID is available in X-Pf-Run-Id header
- Synchronous calls return detailed step results
- Asynchronous calls return immediately with no body
- Look for selectedResult in response for configured output
- Step results include logs and execution times
