## Why Use Summarize?

The `/summarize` command helps you quickly create concise summaries of any text content. Perfect for:

- Condensing long documents
- Creating meeting notes highlights
- Extracting key points from articles
- Summarizing email threads
- Creating executive summaries

## Basic Usage

Simply use the command followed by your text:

```
/summarize the following meeting notes:
We talked about Q4 targets and the new marketing strategy. We also discussed the budget constraints and the project timeline. We approved the new client onboarding process and a lot of other stuff....
```

## Summarizing Files

You can also ask for a file to be summarized. For example

```
/summarize the following meeting notes:
[Uploaded TXT file]
```

## Output formats

By default, the output is a JSON object. If you want a more readable format, you can ask for it in markdown. For example

```
/summarize the following meeting notes in markdown format
We talked about Q4 targets and the new marketing strategy. We also discussed the budget constraints and the project timeline. We approved the new client onboarding proces and a lot of other stuff....
```
