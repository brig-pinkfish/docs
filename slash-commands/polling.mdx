## What can you do with it?

Polling allows you to create long-running monitoring jobs that wait for external services to complete. This is perfect for tracking job statuses, waiting for processing to finish, handling asynchronous workflows, and integrating with services that require polling for results like video processing, data analysis, or web crawling. The service automatically handles retries, timeouts, and triggers callbacks when operations complete.
