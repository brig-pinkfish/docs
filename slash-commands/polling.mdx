## What can you do with it?

The `/polling` command enables you to monitor long-running operations from external services and automatically trigger callbacks when they complete. You can track job statuses, wait for processing to finish, handle asynchronous workflows, and integrate with services that require polling for results like video processing, data analysis, or web crawling.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/polling start [configuration]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `pollUrl` - The URL to poll for status updates
- `pollUrlToken` - Authentication token for polling requests
- `callbackUrl` - URL to call when polling succeeds
- `callbackUrlToken` - Authentication token for callback
- `expectedResultPattern` - Pattern to match for success (path or string)
- `callbackPayload` - Data to send when job completes
- `pollTime` - Total time to poll (1m to 12h)
- `pollFrequency` - How often to check (5s to 5m)

**Optional:**

- `headers` - Additional headers for polling requests
- `errorCallback` - Different URL for error notifications

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "message": "Polling started successfully",
  "jobId": "poll_1234567890_abc123",
  "estimatedDuration": "5m",
  "frequency": "30s",
  "maxAttempts": 10
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/polling start monitoring job 123
poll url: https://api.example.com/job/status/123
with token: your-api-token
notify webhook: https://your-app.com/webhook
webhook token: webhook-token
wait for: status.completed to exist
send message: Job 123 completed
check every: 30 seconds
for up to: 5 minutes
```
Polls a job status endpoint every 30 seconds for up to 5 minutes until status.completed exists.

### Advanced Usage
```
/polling monitor firecrawl job abc-123
poll url: https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/abc-123
api key: firecrawl-api-key
callback url: https://your-automation/callback
callback token: callback-token
wait for text: completed
send crawl results with id, total pages, and data
poll every: 1 minute
timeout after: 30 minutes
```
Monitors a web crawling job, extracting specific data from results using template variables.

### Specific Use Case
```
/polling wait for video processing
check url: https://video-api.com/process/video-456
using token: video-api-key
notify when done: https://your-app.com/video-ready
auth token: app-token
wait for: output.url to be available
send video id and download url when ready
check every: 2 minutes
maximum wait: 1 hour
```
Waits for video processing to complete, then sends the download URL when ready.

### Notes

**Pattern Types:**
- path: Checks if a JSON path exists (e.g., "result.status")
- stringMatch: Checks if response contains specific text

**Time Formats:**
- Poll Time: 1m to 12h (e.g., "30m", "2h")
- Poll Frequency: 5s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 1m, 3m, 5m

**Template Variables:**
- Use {{results}} to inject polling results into callbacks
- Access nested data with {{results.path.to.data}}
