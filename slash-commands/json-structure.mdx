## Why Use JSON Structure?

Transform any type of unstructured business data into clean, organized JSON objects. This powerful tool can:

- **Standardize Data**: Convert messy business documents, emails, and reports into consistent JSON formats
- **Extract Information**: Pull specific data points into structured objects ready for system integration
- **Create Relationships**: Map complex connections between business entities, departments, and data points
- **Automate Parsing**: Turn manual data entry and processing into automated structured workflows
- **Enable Integration**: Make your data ready for API consumption and cross-system compatibility

Common business problems this solves:

- Converting legacy documents into structured data
- Standardizing data from multiple sources
- Creating API-ready data structures
- Extracting specific business metrics from reports
- Organizing unstructured communications into actionable data

## Content Input Options

You can provide content to structure in two ways:

1. **Direct Text**:

```
/json-structure structure this data: [paste your content here]
```

2. **File Upload**:

```
/json-structure structure the content from this file: [file URL]
```

Supported file types:

- Text files (.txt)
- Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- CSV files (.csv)
- PDF files (.pdf)
- JSON files (for restructuring)
- XML files
- HTML files

## Basic Usage

The `/json-structure` command uses AI to intelligently convert text or file content into JSON. You have two approaches:

1. **Specify Your Structure**:

```
/json-structure convert this sales report using this structure:
{
  "quarter": string,
  "revenue": number,
  "regions": array of objects
}

[your content or file URL]
```

2. **Let AI Choose Structure**:

```
/json-structure structure this sales report in the most logical way:
[your content or file URL]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Structure Specification**

   - Be explicit about required fields when needed
   - Use clear field names
   - Indicate data types for critical fields
   - Specify array vs object preferences

2. **Data Preparation**

   - Ensure source files are accessible
   - Clean obvious formatting issues
   - Break very large files into manageable chunks
   - Consider data sensitivity

3. **Output Optimization**

   - Request specific nesting levels
   - Indicate preferred naming conventions
   - Specify date and number formats
   - Request validation of critical fields

4. **Common Use Patterns**
   - Start with broader structures and refine
   - Use consistent naming across related requests
   - Include metadata for traceability
   - Consider downstream system requirements

## Tips for Success

1. **Clear Instructions**

   - Specify business context
   - Indicate critical fields
   - Mention any special handling requirements
   - Include validation requirements

2. **Data Organization**

   - Group related information logically
   - Maintain consistent structure across similar data
   - Consider relationships between data elements
   - Think about how the data will be used

3. **Quality Control**
   - Request format validation
   - Specify required fields
   - Include data type checking
   - Consider adding metadata

Remember: The more specific you are about your business requirements, the better the structured output will match your needs!
