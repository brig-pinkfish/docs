## Why Use JSON Structure?

Transform any type of unstructured data into clean, organized JSON objects. This powerful tool can:

- **Standardize Data**: Convert unstructured business data into consistent JSON formats
- **Extract Information**: Pull specific data points into structured objects
- **Create Relationships**: Map connections between different business entities
- **Automate Parsing**: Turn manual data processing into automated structure
- **Enable Integration**: Make data ready for API consumption and system integration

## Basic Usage

The `/json-structure` command uses AI to intelligently convert text into JSON. You can either:

1. **Specify Your Structure**:

```
/json-structure convert this sales report using this structure:
{
  "quarter": string,
  "revenue": number,
  "regions": array of objects
}

[your content]
```

2. **Let AI Choose Structure**:

```
/json-structure structure this sales report in the most logical way:
[your content]
```

## Business Use Cases
