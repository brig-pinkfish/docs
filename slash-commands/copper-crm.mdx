## Notes 

Copper CRM uses Unix timestamps for date fields. Phone numbers and emails can have categories such as work, personal, or mobile. Custom fields require the custom_field_definition_id which is specific to your Copper instance. The record_type parameter accepts leads, people, companies, opportunities, projects, tasks, or activities. When creating or updating records with addresses, all address fields (street, city, state, postal_code, country) should be provided together.
