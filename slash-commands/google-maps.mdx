## What can you do with it?

Google Maps allows you to access comprehensive location services programmatically. You can convert addresses to coordinates (geocoding), search for places by name or type, get detailed information about specific locations, calculate distances and travel times between multiple points, obtain elevation data, and get turn-by-turn directions. This integration is perfect for location-based applications, travel planning, and geographic data analysis.

## How to use it?

## Notes 

All user-provided inputs are automatically encoded to prevent errors. For multiple origins or destinations, separate them with pipe characters (|). Coordinates should be provided in decimal degrees format (latitude,longitude). Travel modes include driving, walking, bicycling, and transit. Place IDs obtained from search results can be used to get detailed information about specific locations.
