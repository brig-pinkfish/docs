## Notes 

The integration uses Microsoft Graph API through the PinkConnect proxy. Email attachments are accessed through the contentBytes field in attachment metadata. Calendar events use ISO 8601 date/time format. Search queries cannot be combined with ordering operations. Todo lists must be retrieved first to get list IDs for task operations. The connection ID is required for all operations.
