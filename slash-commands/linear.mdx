## Notes 

Linear uses GraphQL API with all requests as POST to the graphql endpoint. Team IDs are mandatory for creating issues - always ask users for team_id when required. Issue identifiers follow the pattern TEAM-NUMBER (e.g., DEV-123). Priority levels are 1-4 where 1 is urgent and 4 is low. Workflow states have types like backlog, unstarted, started, completed, and canceled. All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format. Labels have color codes for visual organization. The system supports nested data structures for comprehensive issue tracking.
