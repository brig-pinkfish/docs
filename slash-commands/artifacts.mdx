## What can you do with it?

Access and process output files (artifacts) from previous automation steps. Read data, extract content from documents, combine results, and work with various file formats seamlessly.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/artifacts
action: get data from previous step
file: the artifact file name
step: which step to get it from
```

### Parameters
- **action**: What to do (get, list, extract, combine)
- **file**: Artifact filename or pattern
- **step** (optional): Step ID (like 'a3x7') or step number
- **property** (optional): Specific JSON property to extract
- **format** (optional): How to process the file

### Response Format
Returns the requested data parsed and ready to use, or lists available artifacts with their metadata.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
Get data from a previous step:
```
/artifacts
action: get data from step a3x7
file: results.json
```

### Advanced Usage
Extract specific property from JSON:
```
/artifacts
action: get user email from previous step
file: user-data.json
step: b2y9
property: contact.email
```

### Specific Use Case
Combine results from multiple steps:
```
/artifacts
action: combine all CSV files into one dataset
file pattern: *.csv
steps: all previous steps
```

### Notes
- Automatically parses JSON and CSV files
- Extracts text from PDFs, Word docs, Excel, and PowerPoint
- Supports regex patterns for finding multiple files
- Returns null if artifact not found
- Step IDs (like 'a3x7') are more stable than step numbers
