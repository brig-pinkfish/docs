## Using The CSV Command

The CSV command works best when you use it in two steps:

### Step 1: Understand Your Data

First, tell the command what you want to do. It will show you the structure of your data:

```
/csv show me sales data for South American countries from sales_global.csv
```

The command will output something like:
```
CSV Structure Found:
Headers: ["date", "country", "product", "sales", "revenue"]
First 5 rows:
1. date: 2024-01-01, country: Brazil, product: Widget A, sales: 150, revenue: 15000
2. date: 2024-01-01, country: Argentina, product: Widget B, sales: 120, revenue: 12000
3. date: 2024-01-01, country: Chile, product: Widget A, sales: 90, revenue: 9000
4. date: 2024-01-02, country: Brazil, product: Widget C, sales: 200, revenue: 20000
5. date: 2024-01-02, country: Peru, product: Widget B, sales: 75, revenue: 7500
```

### Step 2: Continue Your Analysis

Now that you can see your data structure, continue with your specific analysis:

```
/csv Great, now calculate total revenue by country and sort from highest to lowest
```

## Example Workflows

### Sales Analysis
```
Step 1:
/csv analyze monthly sales by product from sales_2024.csv

Step 2:
/csv calculate the growth rate between months and highlight products growing over 10%
```

### Customer Data
```
Step 1:
/csv show me customer satisfaction scores from feedback.csv

Step 2:
/csv break this down by region and show me average scores for each category
```

### Inventory Analysis
```
Step 1:
/csv check inventory levels from stock_levels.csv

Step 2:
/csv identify items below reorder point and sort by current stock level
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   * Begin with a basic request to see your data
   * Check the column names in the structure output
   * Verify the data format in the sample rows
   * Then build your analysis

2. **Clear Requests**
   * Specify the CSV file name
   * State what you want to analyze
   * Be specific about calculations
   * Mention any sorting or filtering needed

3. **Build Analysis**
   * Use the column names exactly as shown
   * Reference the data types you saw
   * Specify any grouping needed
   * Indicate how you want results sorted

## Tips for Success

1. **First Step**
   * Always start with a request that will show you the data
   * Check column names carefully
   * Note the format of dates, numbers, etc.
   * Verify the countries, categories, or other key fields

2. **Second Step**
   * Use the exact column names you saw
   * Build on what you learned about your data
   * Be specific about calculations
   * Indicate how you want results formatted

Remember: Let the first step show you what's in your data, then build your analysis in the second step!
