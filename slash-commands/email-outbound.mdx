## Why Use Email Outbound?

The `/email-outbound` command helps you quickly send emails directly from your workspace. Perfect for:

- Sending quick updates to colleagues
- Forwarding reports to stakeholders
- Distributing newsletters
- Following up with customers
- Sending meeting summaries

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to send an email is using the command with a recipient and message:

```
/email-outbound send email to "tom@work.com" with message "Here is a report for you regarding our Q4 results."
```

## Sender Information

All emails sent through the email-outbound command will come from:
**Pinkfish Email** `<mail@pinkfish-email.com>`

This sender address cannot be changed and helps recipients identify emails coming from your Pinkfish workflow.

## Advanced Options

You can enhance your emails with these additional options:

### Subject Lines

Add a custom subject line to your email:

```
/email-outbound send email to "jane@company.com" with subject "Weekly Update" with message "Here are this week's metrics..."
```

### CC and BCC Recipients

Include additional recipients using CC and BCC:

```
/email-outbound send email to "team@company.com" cc "manager@company.com" with message "Team update for this sprint..."
```

### Reply-To Address

Set a specific reply-to address:

```
/email-outbound send email to "customer@example.com" reply-to "support@ourcompany.com" with message "Thank you for your inquiry..."
```

### HTML Formatting

Send formatted HTML emails:

```
/email-outbound send email to "marketing@company.com" with html "<h1>Campaign Results</h1><p>Our Q4 campaign showed...</p>"
```

### File Attachments

Include file attachments with your email:

```
/email-outbound send email to "finance@company.com" with message "Please find the attached report" with files ["Q4_Report.pdf"]
```

## Rate Limits

To ensure optimal service quality, the following rate limits apply:

- **Per Minute**: 10 emails
- **Daily**: 25 emails

You'll receive a notification when approaching these limits. The response will show your current usage:

```json

  "minutely": {
    "current": 1,
    "limit": 10
  },
  "daily": {
    "current": 23,
    "limit": 25
  }
}
```

## Creating Email Loops with Triggers

You can create powerful email workflow loops by combining email-outbound with email triggers. Here's how:

1. Set up an email trigger in your workflow to generate a unique email address (e.g., `ctqe6aa8s9s3js89@pinkfish.email`)
2. When emails are sent to this trigger address, their contents are sent to your workflow
3. Use email-outbound to reply to the original sender by:
   - Setting their email as the "to" address
   - Setting your trigger email as the "reply-to" address

Example:

```
/email-outbound send email to "customer@example.com" reply-to "ctqe6aa8s9s3js89@pinkfish.email" with message "Thanks for your inquiry..."
```

This creates a loop where:

- Your workflow receives an email
- You reply using email-outbound
- The recipient replies to your trigger email
- Your workflow processes the reply and can respond again

This is perfect for creating automated email conversations, support ticket systems, or email-based workflows.

## Common Issues

- **Missing Recipient**: Always include a "to" email address
- **Empty Message**: Provide either a plain text message or HTML content
- **Rate Limits**: If you hit a limit, wait until the next period or contact sales for higher limits

The command will provide helpful error messages if you forget any required information or hit rate limits.
