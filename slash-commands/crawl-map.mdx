## What can you do with it?

Crawl Map provides the easiest way to go from a single URL to a map of the entire website. This is extremely useful when you need to prompt the end-user to choose which links to scrape, need to quickly know the links on a website, need to find pages related to a specific topic using the search parameter, or only need to identify specific pages before scraping. The map endpoint is optimized for speed and returns URLs with titles and descriptions. Supports location settings for geo-specific site mapping.

## How to use it?
