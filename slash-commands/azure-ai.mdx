## What can you do with it?

The `/azure-ai` command enables you to interact with Azure OpenAI models through the Azure AI API. Perfect for generating text responses, creating AI-powered conversations, and leveraging various GPT models including GPT-5, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 series for different use cases.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/your-azure-ai-connection [action] [required-parameters] [optional-parameters]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `deployment` - The Azure deployment name (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-35-turbo)
- `api_version` - The API version to use

**Optional:**

- `max_tokens` - Maximum number of tokens to generate (default: 800)
- `temperature` - Controls randomness in responses (0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.2)
- `system` - System prompt to guide model behavior

## Tools

### Chat Completions
Generate a response from the model for the given chat conversation

**Parameters:**
- `deployment` (required) - Azure deployment name
- `api_version` (required) - API version
- `max_tokens` (optional) - Maximum response length
- `temperature` (optional) - Response randomness control
- `messages` (required) - Array of conversation messages

**Example:**
```
/your-azure-ai-connection
action: chat_completions
deployment: gpt-4
api_version: 2024-08-06
max_tokens: 800
temperature: 0.2
messages: [{"role": "system", "content": "Follow the user's instructions"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The capital of France is Paris."
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 25,
    "completion_tokens": 7,
    "total_tokens": 32
  }
}
```

## Notes

Available models include GPT-5 series for advanced reasoning, GPT-4.1 series for enhanced capabilities, GPT-4 series with vision support, and GPT-3.5 series for efficient processing. The deployment and api_version parameters are automatically handled by your Azure AI connector configuration.
