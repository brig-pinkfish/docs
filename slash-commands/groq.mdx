## What can you do with it?

Use Groq for high-speed AI inference with various open-source models. Ideal for applications requiring fast response times, high throughput, and efficient processing. The command provides access to multiple models with varying capabilities and context lengths for different use cases.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/groq [prompt] [optional-parameters]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `prompt` - Your instructions or questions

**Optional:**

- `model` - Specific model to use (defaults to meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct)

- `system prompt` - Override the default system prompt

- `files` - File URLs to include in the request

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "response": "Model's generated response",
  "format": "Response format (JSON/plaintext/markdown/HTML)",
  "metadata": {
    "model": "Model used",
    "context_length": "Available context length"
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/groq
prompt: Summarize the key benefits of renewable energy
```
Gets a quick response summarizing renewable energy benefits.

### Advanced Usage
```
/groq
prompt: Solve this complex mathematical problem step by step
model: deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
system prompt: You are a mathematics professor
```
Uses a specific model optimized for complex reasoning with a custom system prompt.

### Specific Use Case
```
/groq
prompt: Analyze this lengthy document and extract key insights
files: document.pdf
model: meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct
```
Processes long documents using a model with extended context length.

### Notes 

Available models include meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct (131K context, default), deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, llama-3.1-8b-instant, mixtral-8x7b-32768, and gemma2-9b-it. Default response format is JSON.
