# Amazon S3

## What can you do with it?

Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. With this skill, you can:

- **File Management**: Upload, download, and delete files of any type (text, images, PDFs, etc.)
- **Folder Organization**: Create and delete folders to organize your files
- **Bucket Operations**: List all buckets in your account
- **Content Listing**: List files and folders with metadata (size, last modified date, etc.)
- **Binary File Access**: Direct access to images, PDFs, and other binary files
- **Presigned URLs**: Generate temporary URLs for secure file sharing
- **Text File Operations**: Upload and view text/JSON files with content validation

## How to use it?

To use Amazon S3, you'll need to connect your S3 account first. Once connected, you can perform file operations using the command format:
