## Notes 

Both PinkConnect and Paragon proxies are supported for Teams operations. Rich messages support HTML formatting for enhanced visual presentation. Messages are sent on behalf of the authenticated user. Team and channel IDs are required for messaging - use the listing tools to obtain these IDs first. The membershipType field in channels indicates standard or private channels.
