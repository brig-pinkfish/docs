## Notes 

Search results are paginated with 10 results per page by default. The start parameter accepts multiples of 10 for pagination (0, 10, 20). For local results, pagination uses multiples of 20. Location parameters can be city-level (e.g., "New York") or use country/language codes. The safe search filter helps exclude adult content. Different search types (images, videos, news, etc.) return specialized result formats.
