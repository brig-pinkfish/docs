## What can you do with it?

Split PDF files into smaller chunks. Supports both URL-based splitting and direct file uploads, perfect for breaking down large documents into manageable pieces. Puts chunks into the file store collection that you specify. Does not retrun the chunks directly, since there may be many.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
Use pdf-splitter skill with collectionId:XXX
file: the PDF file to split
pages per chunk: number of pages per split file
```

### Parameters
- **file**: URL of the PDF file to split or PDF content to upload
- **pages per chunk**: Number of pages per split chunk (e.g., 2 means 2 pages per file)
- **collection id** (required): Collection ID for grouping split files - must be provided in user prompt
- **file links expire in days** (optional): Number of days before download links expire - defaults to 4
- **split into pages type** (optional): Always set to "PDF" for PDF splitting

### Response Format
Returns an array of split PDF files with metadata including file IDs, filenames with page ranges, file sizes, and a collection ID. Provides URLs for accessing files instead of automatically downloading them.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
Split PDF into 2-page chunks:
```
Use pdf-splitter skill with collectionId:GL7O7FAfCY3RvWgv4E56
