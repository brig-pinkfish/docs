## What can you do with it?

Find the most similar strings from a list by comparing them to a search term. This is useful for fuzzy matching, finding near-duplicates, or ranking items by similarity.

## How does it work?

The similarity search uses **Levenshtein distance** to measure how similar two strings are. This algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.

**Distance Scoring:**
- **Distance 0**: Identical strings
- **Distance 1**: One character different ("cat" vs "bat")
- **Distance 2**: Two edits needed ("cat" vs "dog")
- **Lower scores = more similar**

**Smart Extraction:**
When enabled, smart extraction focuses on meaningful parts of text by:
1. **Splitting** text using the specified character (default: `/`)
2. **Excluding** common patterns like version numbers, dates, file extensions
3. **Comparing** only the relevant extracted parts

**Example:** Instead of comparing entire file paths, it extracts just the meaningful filename parts:
- `"documents/reports/quarterly_sales_report_2024_v2.pdf"` → `"quarterly sales report"`
- `"documents/archive/quarterly_sales_report_2023_final.pdf"` → `"quarterly sales report"`
- **Result:** Distance 0 (identical after extraction)

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/similarity-search
search term: the string you want to find matches for
items to search: array of strings to compare against
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `search term` - The string you want to find matches for

- `items to search` - Array of strings to search through

**Optional:**

- `use smart extraction` - Extract and compare only the most relevant parts of paths (default: false)

- `exclude patterns` - Patterns to exclude during smart extraction (default: none)

- `split value` - Character used to split paths when using smart extraction (default: /)

- `max results` - Maximum number of results to return (default: 5)

### Response Format

The command returns:
```
A ranked list of matches with their similarity distances (lower distance = more similar)
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/similarity-search
search term: lpsum string to compare
items to search: ["first lpsum string", "another possible match", "completely different text", "lpsum sample"]
max results: 3
```
Find similar product names from a list

### Advanced Usage
```
/similarity-search
search term: quarterly sales report
items to search: ["documents/reports/quarterly_sales_report_2024_v2.pdf", "documents/reports/monthly_sales_summary_2024_final.pdf", "documents/reports/quarterly_financial_report_2024_draft.pdf", "documents/archive/quarterly_sales_report_2023_final.pdf"]
use smart extraction: true
exclude patterns: ["2024", "2023", "v2", "final", "draft"]
split value: /
```
Find similar document names by extracting meaningful parts from file paths, ignoring version numbers and dates

### Specific Use Case
```
/similarity-search
search term: John Smith
items to search: ["Jon Smith", "John Smyth", "Jane Smith", "John Schmidt", "Johnny Smith"]
max results: 5
```
Find similar customer names in a database for deduplication
