## What can you do with it?

Find the most similar strings from a list by comparing them to a search term. This is useful for fuzzy matching, finding near-duplicates, or ranking items by similarity.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/similarity-search
search term: the string you want to find matches for
items to search: array of strings to compare against
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `search term` - The string you want to find matches for

- `items to search` - Array of strings to search through

**Optional:**

- `use smart extraction` - Extract and compare only the most relevant parts of paths (default: false)

- `exclude patterns` - Patterns to exclude during smart extraction (default: none)

- `split value` - Character used to split paths when using smart extraction (default: /)

- `max results` - Maximum number of results to return (default: 5)

### Response Format

The command returns:
```
A ranked list of matches with their similarity distances (lower distance = more similar)
```

## Examples
