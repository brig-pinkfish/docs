### TBS (To Be Searched) Parameter Guide

The tbs parameter enables precise filtering of search results:

#### 1. Price Filtering
```
# Required format for price filters:
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_min:[amount]     # Items over [amount]
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_max:[amount]     # Items under [amount]
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_min:[amount],ppr_max:[amount]  # Items between amounts

# Examples:
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_max:300      # Find items under $300
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_min:500      # Find items over $500
tbs=mr:1,price:1,ppr_min:200,ppr_max:500  # Find items $200-$500
```
Note: `mr:1,price:1` are required codes that enable price filtering. Always include them when filtering by price.

#### 2. Product Condition
```
# Filter by item condition:
tbs=condition:1      # New items only
tbs=condition:2      # Used items only
tbs=condition:3      # Refurbished items only
tbs=condition:1,2    # Both new and used items
```

#### 3. Availability & Sales
```
# Filter by stock and sale status:
tbs=merchant:1     # In stock items only
tbs=sale:1         # Items on sale only

# Combine filters:
tbs=sale:1,merchant:1    # In-stock items that are on sale
```

#### 4. Shipping Options
```
# Filter by shipping terms:
tbs=ship:0    # Any shipping method

```
