## Why Use Transcribe?

The `/transcribe` command converts audio content into text. Perfect for:

- Converting meeting recordings to text
- Transcribing interviews
- Creating subtitles for videos
- Documenting voice notes
- Processing podcast content

## Basic Usage

Simply use the command with an audio URL or uploaded file:

```
/transcribe https://example.com/audio/meeting-recording.mp3
```

Or with an uploaded file:

```
/transcribe
[Uploaded audio file]
```

## Language Support

Currently, the transcription service:
- Only transcribes English-language speech
- Outputs transcriptions in English
- Does not support translation to other languages

## Output Formats

By default, the output is a JSON object. For a more readable format, specify markdown:

```
/transcribe in markdown format
[Uploaded audio file]
```

## Supported Formats

Audio files:
AAC (audio/aac)
FLAC (audio/flac)
MP3 (audio/mp3)
WAV (audio/wav)
OGG Vorbis (audio/ogg)
AIFF (audio/aiff)

Note: Each format should be provided with the appropriate MIME type (e.g., audio/mp3, audio/wav). The system will automatically detect and process the correct format.
