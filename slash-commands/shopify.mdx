## Notes 

Shopify uses the Admin API version 2023-04 with REST endpoints. Customer search supports queries like "email:customer@example.com" for precise matching. Orders require line items with variant IDs and quantities. Address information includes first_name, last_name, address1, city, province, country, and zip fields. Products can have multiple variants with different options, prices, and SKUs. Financial status for orders includes values like "paid", "pending", "authorized". All monetary values are returned as strings. The API supports pagination for large datasets.
