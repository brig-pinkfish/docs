The `/3d-app` command enables you to create web-based 3D applications powered by Babylon.js. It's experimental. We haven't got great results from it yet. But if you do, let us know! You can use it for. 

- Creating interactive 3D product experiences
- Building product configurators
- Developing architectural walkthroughs
- Constructing educational 3D models
- Prototyping game mechanics
- Showcasing 3D designs

See the Babylon.js documentation here https://www.babylonjs.com/ 
And the amazing forum here https://forum.babylonjs.com/

## Basic Usage

Use the command followed by a description of the 3D experience you want to create. Be specific about:
- Scene elements and objects
- Camera positioning
- Lighting setup
- Interactions and animations
- Material properties

```
/3d-app create a scene with a rotating cube that changes color when clicked
```

## Example Applications

### Basic 3D Viewer
```
/3d-app create a simple viewer for a 3D model with orbit controls and ambient lighting
For model use file [uploaded glb file or URL to glb file]
```

For example:
```
Use 3d-app skill to create a simple viewer for a 3D model with orbit controls and ambient lighting
For model use file: https://bjs-playground.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sofa_018.glb
```

### Interactive Product Display
```
/3d-app create a product showcase where users can rotate the model and zoom in/out
For model use file [uploaded glb file or URL to glb file]
```

## Key Features

### Camera Types
- ArcRotateCamera: Orbits around a target point
- FreeCamera: First-person perspective
- FollowCamera: Follows a target object
- UniversalCamera: Combines keyboard and mouse controls

### Lighting Options
- HemisphericLight: Ambient lighting from above
- PointLight: Light emitting from a point
- SpotLight: Focused cone of light
- DirectionalLight: Parallel light rays

### Materials
- StandardMaterial: Basic material with properties
- PBRMaterial: Physically based rendering
- BackgroundMaterial: For skyboxes
- Custom shaders: For advanced effects

### Interactions
- Pointer events (click, hover)
- Keyboard controls
- Physics interactions
- Custom animations

## Saving and Sharing

Save your 3D applications using the file storage command:
```
/filestorage write [previous 3D app result] to "product-viewer-3d"
```

This creates a shareable link for:
- Direct access to the application
- Embedding in web pages
- Testing and review
- Collaboration

## Iterative Development

Refining your 3D application may take several iterations. You can:
1. Start with basic geometry and functionality
2. Add materials and lighting
3. Implement interactions
4. Fine-tune performance
5. Add polish and effects

If the command seems to lose context, try:
1. Save your last working version
2. Clear the conversation
3. Restore from the saved version
4. Continue iterations with refined prompts

## Advanced Features

### Custom Shaders
Request custom shader effects:
```
/3d-app add a water shader to my ocean scene with realistic waves
```

### Physics
Add physical interactions:
```
/3d-app add collision detection and gravity to the falling objects
```

### Animation
Create complex animations:
```
/3d-app make the character walk in a figure-eight pattern
```

### Environment
Set up atmospheric effects:
```
/3d-app add fog and dynamic shadows to the scene
```

The 3D App command provides a powerful way to create interactive 3D web experiences. Start simple and build up complexity as needed for your use case.
