## What can you do with it?

The `/image-generate` command enables you to create unique images from text descriptions using the high-performance Flux Schnell model. You can generate artwork, product mockups, marketing visuals, concept designs, illustrations, and professional graphics by simply describing what you want to see, with precise control over style, composition, and quality.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure
```
/image-generate [description]
```

### Parameters

**Required:**

- `prompt` - Text description of the image you want to generate

**Optional:**

- `aspect_ratio` - Image dimensions: "1:1", "16:9", "21:9", "3:2", "2:3", "4:5", "5:4", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", "9:21" (defaults to "1:1")
- `num_outputs` - Number of variations to generate: 1-4 (defaults to 1)
- `num_inference_steps` - Number of denoising steps: 1-4 (defaults to 4). Lower steps = faster but lower quality
- `seed` - Random seed for reproducible generation (integer, optional)
- `output_format` - Format of output images: "webp", "jpg", "png" (defaults to "webp")
- `output_quality` - Quality when saving images: 0-100 (defaults to 80). Not relevant for PNG outputs
- `disable_safety_checker` - Disable safety checker for generated images (boolean, defaults to false)
- `go_fast` - Run faster predictions with fp8 quantized model (boolean, defaults to true). Note: outputs not deterministic when enabled
- `megapixels` - Approximate megapixels for generated image: "1", "0.25" (defaults to "1")
- `fileLinksExpireInDays` - How long generated files remain accessible: 1-7 days (defaults to 7)
- `fileLinksExpireInMinutes` - How long generated files remain accessible in minutes (takes precedence over days)

### Response Format

The command returns:
```json
{
  "output": [
    {
      "url": "https://generated-file-url",
      "mimeType": "image/webp"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** All generated images are automatically saved to your "Multimedia Artifact" file store and will be accessible for the duration specified by the `fileLinksExpireInDays` parameter.

### Social Media Content
```
/image-generate
prompt: Instagram-style flat lay of a cozy reading nook with books, coffee cup, and warm lighting, aesthetic composition
aspect_ratio: 9:16
output_format: webp
go_fast: true
megapixels: 1
```
Generates vertical content optimized for Instagram stories with fast processing.

### Character Design
```
/image-generate
prompt: Character design of a friendly robot mascot for a children's app, colorful, approachable, cartoon style
aspect_ratio: 1:1
num_outputs: 4
num_inference_steps: 4
output_quality: 90
```
Creates multiple character variations for design iteration.

### Architectural Visualization
```
/image-generate
prompt: Architectural rendering of a sustainable eco-friendly house with solar panels, green roof, large windows, modern design
aspect_ratio: 21:9
output_format: jpg
output_quality: 85
fileLinksExpireInDays: 7
```

### Notes

**Model Capabilities:**
- Fast generation (typically 10-30 seconds)
- High-quality outputs with professional results
- Excellent for commercial and creative use cases
- Supports various artistic styles and photorealistic imagery

**Limitations:**
- Cannot generate images of specific real people
- Avoids creating harmful or inappropriate content
- Results may vary based on prompt complexity
- Video generation is not supported
