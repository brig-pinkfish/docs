## Introduction

The AI Agent command allows you to create and interact with persistent AI agents that maintain conversation history across multiple interactions. Each agent can be customized with specific personalities, knowledge domains, and behavioral traits through a system prompt, while maintaining context and memory of previous interactions through a thread ID system.

- [Best Practices](#best-practices)

## Basic Usage

Create and interact with an AI agent using the `/ai-agent` command followed by the required fields:

```
/ai-agent
systemPrompt: "Your name is Alex and you are a helpful assistant specializing in corporate travel booking."
userMessage: "What hotels are in NYC around the Empire State Building?"
threadId: "user-123-travel-booking-89384"
```

## Command Structure

The AI Agent command follows this basic structure:

```
/ai-agent
* systemPrompt: [agent definition]
* userMessage: [user's current query]
* threadId: [unique thread identifier - you can make this up - it doesn't matter as long as it's unique per conversation]
* messageHistory: [optional - use only if you want to provide a custom message history]
```

## Required Fields

### 1. threadId

- Unique identifier for storing conversation history
- Allows continuity across multiple interactions
- All interactions are stored in your datastore
- Format suggestion: `[userId]-[purpose]-[uniqueId]`

### 2. userMessage

- The current query or message from the user
- Can be a question, command, or conversation continuation
- The agent will respond based on this input and previous context

### 3. systemPrompt

- Defines the agent's personality, knowledge, and behavior
- Sets boundaries and capabilities
- Can include:
  - Name and identity
  - Area of expertise
  - Behavioral traits
  - Response style
  - Limitations and constraints
  - Available tasks and tools (see below)

## Optional Fields

### messageHistory

- Override default history retrieval
- Useful for:
  - Testing different conversation flows
  - Importing conversations from other sources
  - Modifying conversation context
- Must still include threadId even when providing custom history

## Examples

1. **Customer Service Agent**

```
/ai-agent
systemPrompt: "You are a customer service agent named Sarah. You have detailed knowledge of our AI automation platform, including pricing plans, features, and common troubleshooting steps. You should answer questions clearly and concisely, provide step-by-step guidance when needed, and know when to escalate to technical support. Your responses should reflect our product documentation and maintain a helpful, professional tone."
userMessage: "I'm trying to use the /scraper command but keep getting a timeout error. Can you help?"
threadId: "support-ticket-789"
```

2. **Sales Development Agent**

```
/ai-agent
systemPrompt: "You are Alex from our sales team. Your role is to qualify leads, schedule product demos, and provide initial product information. You have access to our demo scheduling calendar and can explain our key features and pricing tiers. Always collect company name, use case, and team size when booking demos. You should be friendly but professional, and focus on understanding the prospect's needs."
userMessage: "I'm interested in seeing how AI could help with our customer service automation."
threadId: "sales-demo-456"
```

3. **Sales Analytics Agent**

```
/ai-agent
systemPrompt: "You are a sales analytics assistant. You have access to our sales pipeline data and can provide detailed analysis of opportunities, conversion rates, and revenue forecasts. You should be able to break down data by region, product line, and sales stage. Always provide specific numbers and percentages in your analysis, and highlight any significant trends or concerns."
userMessage: "What's our current pipeline value for Q4, and how many deals are expected to close?"
threadId: "sales-analytics-123"
```

## Advanced Prompting & Tools

The examples above show very simple agent prompts. Simple prompts will work for simple conversations. However, you can create a detailed agent prompt that guides your agent to perform designated tasks in a specific order, with specific steps, and with tools that you have created on Pinkfish.

Although many formats may work with the agent framework, here is a template that we've tested and that works reliably.

```xml
<assistant>
    <assistant_name>YourAgentName</assistant_name>

    <backstory>
    Define your agent's background and context here.
    </backstory>

    <goal>
    Define what the agent aims to accomplish.
    </goal>

    <guardrails>
    * List behavioral restrictions
    * Define what the agent should not do
    </guardrails>

    <personality>
    Define how the agent should interact and communicate.
    </personality>

    <response_format>
    Define the structure of agent responses, including:
    - Required JSON format
    - Tool call formats
    - Any special formatting requirements
    </response_format>

## Tools

One of the most powerful features of the AI Agent framework is the ability to create and use tools on Pinkfish. A tool is just a regular automation where you add an API trigger - and then you give your tool to your agent to use as it sees fit.

The only tip is that when you create an automation and call it via an API trigger, it will return results from each of the steps. That payload is often too much for the agent to handle - it's more than the agent needs. So the agent framework is setup to search for a step result that has the variable "selectedResult" as the output from one of the steps. So as long as you have a step that has that as an output, the agent will be able to find it and use only that.

Here is a screenshot of the selectedResult variable in the step output for a tool that scrapes ticketing websites.

<img alt="Selected Result" src="/images/examples/selectedResult.png" />

## Message History Format

Unless you specify a messageHistory, the framework will automatically create a message history for you. It will look like this:

```xml
<messageHistory>
User: Initial message
Agent: Agent response
tool-call: tool_name, tool_url
prompt: tool_prompt
tool-result: tool_response
User: Follow-up message
Agent: Agent response
</messageHistory>
```

If you want to provide a messageHistory, you can do so by adding the messageHistory field to your request and format it approximately like the example above.

You can review messageHistory in the datastore UI feature. Or you can retrieve it using the following prompt:

```
/ai-agent Get Message History
threadId <threadId>
limit <number of messages to return>
sort <asc or desc>
compiled <true or false> (the example above is compiled)
```

## Testing

Testing AI Agents is the toughest part of developing an agent because it could do so many different things depending on the inputs and depending on how you've written the prompt. One small change in the prompt could cause the agent to behave differently. So you'll want to test with a variety of inputs and see how the agent responds.

You can use the `Test Inputs` feature to run through various scenarios quickly.

<img alt="Test Inputs" src="/images/examples/testInputs.png" />

After setting your test input, run your automation. You'll see the results in the UI.

## Sending and Responding to Inputs

While you can set test inputs to test your agent, generally, you'll want to send inputs to your agent by some other channel, such as:

- SMS
- Email
- Slack
- Web chat
- API
- Whatever you can imagine

And then you'll want to respond to the agent's output in the same way.

As a result, your automation will generally consist of three steps.

1. Receive inputs
2. Call your ai agent
3. Respond to the user with the agent's response

Here is an example of a simple automation that receives an input from email, calls an ai agent, and then responds to the user with the agent's response via a Sendgrid email connection.

<img alt="Simple Automation" src="/images/examples/agentLayout.png" />

You can see in this example that I've put the agent prompt in a file and attached the file to the automation - and then retrieved it as part of the first step. This is a handy way to keep your agent prompt clean and organized, especially if it gets long.

If you want the agent to continue the conversation, make sure that the threadId that you set for the first message comes back around in the next call to this agent automation.
