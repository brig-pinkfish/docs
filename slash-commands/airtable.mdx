## What can you do with it?

The Airtable integration enables comprehensive database management including listing bases, exploring table schemas, retrieving records with advanced filtering, and creating new records. You can work with different field types including text, select options, collaborators, and more. The integration supports powerful filtering with formulas, pagination for large datasets, and bulk record creation. Perfect for teams managing structured data, project tracking, and collaborative databases with rich field types and relationships.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure

## Notes 

Airtable uses app-prefixed base IDs (appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) and rec-prefixed record IDs. Table names and table IDs can be used interchangeably. Field types include singleLineText, multilineText, singleSelect, multipleSelect, singleCollaborator, and many others. Filter formulas use Airtable's formula syntax with field names in curly braces like {Status}='Done'. The typecast option enables automatic data conversion from strings to appropriate field types. Pagination is supported with pageSize (max 100) and offset parameters. Views can filter and sort records according to predefined configurations. All field names are case-sensitive and must match exactly as defined in the base schema.
