## Notes

Figma requires team ID to be provided by the user as there's no endpoint to list available teams. File IDs and node IDs use Figma's unique identifier format. Comments can be placed at specific coordinates within design files. Rendered images support multiple formats including PNG, JPG, SVG, and PDF. Team projects contain multiple design files organized by project categories.
