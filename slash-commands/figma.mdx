## Required Information

### Team ID
When working with teams, you'll need the team ID. Ask your Figma admin or find it in your Figma URL.

### File ID
File IDs are found in Figma URLs after `/file/`:
`https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/Design-Name`

### Node IDs
Node IDs identify specific elements in a design (e.g., "1:2", "1:3")

## Comment Positioning

When adding comments, specify coordinates:
- `x`: Horizontal position
- `y`: Vertical position

## Tips
- Always provide team ID when accessing team resources
- File IDs are found in Figma URLs
- Comments require x,y coordinates
- Reactions use emoji characters
