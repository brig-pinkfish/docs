## What can you do with it?

The `/word-document-process` command enables you to process Word documents (.docx) with AI while preserving all formatting, styles, tables, and structure. You can translate documents to any language, correct grammar and spelling, rewrite content, or simplify language - all while maintaining the original document's visual appearance.

<Info>
This skill uses an advanced Word Document Processor service that preserves all formatting including bold, italic, underline, fonts, colors, highlights, tables, lists, headers, footers, and page structure. Only the text content is modified by AI. The service automatically handles documents of any size efficiently.

## What Gets Preserved

✅ **All formatting is maintained:**
- Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- Font families, sizes, and colors
- Text highlighting and backgrounds
- Paragraph alignment and spacing
- Bulleted and numbered lists
- Tables with all formatting
- Headers and footers
- Page breaks and sections
- Images and charts (untouched)

## Use Cases

### Translation
- Translate contracts, reports, manuals
- Maintain legal document formatting
- Preserve tables and structured content
- Keep brand styling intact

### Grammar Correction
- Clean up drafts before publication
- Fix spelling and grammar errors
- Maintain author's voice and style
- Preserve document structure

### Content Simplification
- Make technical docs accessible
- Create reader-friendly versions
- Simplify legal or medical documents
- Adapt content for different audiences

### Tone Adjustment
- Make formal documents casual
- Professionalize informal writing
- Adapt for different markets
- Adjust for cultural context

### Content Enhancement
- Add examples to existing lists
- Expand sections with more details
- Insert additional items matching existing format
- Enhance documents while preserving style

## Processing Time

Document processing time depends on:
- **Document length**: ~2-5 seconds per page
- **AI model**: Claude is balanced, GPT-4 is fastest, Gemini is most cost-effective
- **Batch size**: Larger batches = fewer API calls but longer per batch
- **Task complexity**: Translation is faster than rewriting

Example: A 10-page document typically processes in 30-60 seconds.

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Model

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (default) - Best for translation and complex reasoning
- **GPT-4.1** - Fastest processing, good for grammar correction
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Most cost-effective, good for simple tasks

### Batch Size Optimization

- **Small documents (<5 pages)**: Use default (50)
- **Medium documents (5-20 pages)**: Increase to 75-100
- **Large documents (>20 pages)**: Consider splitting into sections

### Task Selection

- Use `translate` for language conversion
- Use `grammar-correct` for error fixing only
- Use `simplify` to reduce reading complexity
- Use `rewrite` for tone/style changes with custom instructions

## Advanced Features

### Adding Content to Documents

When explicitly requested, you can add new content to existing documents while preserving formatting:

```javascript
/word-document-process
task: "translate and add content"
target_language: "Spanish"
custom_instruction: "Translate to Spanish and add 15 new entertainment command examples to the entertainment section"
document_source: "uploaded_file:commands.docx"
```

<Info>
When adding content, the skill intelligently clones the formatting from existing paragraphs to maintain consistency. Use a two-pass approach: first transform existing text, then add new content with replicated formatting.
</Info>

**Best for:**
- Adding items to existing lists
- Expanding sections with more examples
- Inserting additional paragraphs with matching style

**Not suitable for:**
- Complex restructuring
- Changing document layout
- Adding entirely new major sections with different formatting

## Limitations

<Warning>
This skill works best for segment-by-segment transformations. It's not suitable for:
- Summarizing content (reduces length)
- Reorganizing document structure
- Extracting specific information
</Warning>

### What This Cannot Do

❌ Translate text within images (requires OCR first)  
❌ Process embedded objects (Excel charts, etc.)  
❌ Handle password-protected documents  
❌ Process older .doc format (only .docx)  
❌ Modify document layout or styles  

### Notes

- Documents must be .docx format (not .doc)
- Very large documents (>100 pages) may take several minutes
- All AI processing uses secure, private processing
- Original document is never modified
- Images and charts are preserved but not processed
