## What can you do with it?

Delete artifact files that were generated in the current workflow run. This is useful for cleaning up files, if you don't want them to persist on Pinkfish storage after a run.

## How to use it?

### Basic Command Structure

```
/delete-artifacts
artifacts: which artifacts to delete
```

### Parameters

- **artifacts**: Which artifacts to delete ("all" or specific filename)
- **include logs** (optional): Whether to include log files

### Current run only

You can only delete artifacts that were generated during the current "Run" execution. If you run individual steps separately, you cannot delete artifacts from previous individual step runs. To delete artifacts from earlier steps, you must use "Run All" (or trigger call) to execute the entire workflow in one session.

### Response Format

Returns detailed results with success/failure counts and specific error messages for failed deletions.

## Examples

### Delete all

```
/delete-artifacts
artifacts: all
```

### Delete by name

```
/delete-artifacts
artifacts: report.pdf
```

### Delete all including logs

```
/delete-artifacts
artifacts: all
include logs: true
```

### Notes

- Current run only: Can only delete files from current "Run" execution
- Log files (stdout.txt) are protected by default unless explicitly requested
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Delete URLs expire after 15 minutes
- Individual step runs cannot delete artifacts from previous steps
