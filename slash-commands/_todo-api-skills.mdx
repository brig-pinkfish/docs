## Notes:
- Template location: `_doc-template-for-api-skills.mdx`
- Source skill files: `/agents/nodejs-claude/skill-*.md` (and other agent directories)
- All skills must have the "api" tag in their metadata
- Use `/your-[SKILLNAME]-connection` format for all commands
- Each skill should have multiple tools/actions documented in the "Tools" section
- No separate "Examples" section needed - examples are included with each tool
