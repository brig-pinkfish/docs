## Why use this?

Pinkfish can generate interactive HTML pages — but a single workflow can only produce output, it can't also listen for incoming requests. To build a web page that submits data (like a form), you need two workflows: one that creates the frontend and one that acts as the backend.

## The Key Concept

In Pinkfish, a workflow produces a result. It can't also be a server that receives requests. So you split the work:

| Workflow | Role | What it does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Workflow 1** | Frontend | Generates HTML and saves it to file storage |
| **Workflow 2** | Backend | Receives form submissions via an API trigger and saves data to the datastore |

The frontend HTML submits data to the backend workflow's API endpoint. The backend processes it and returns a response.

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Create the Frontend Workflow

Build a workflow that generates your HTML page and saves it to file storage.

Your workflow might have steps that gather data, format content, or do other preparation — but the final step creates the HTML and saves it to a file storage collection. Once saved, you get a URL where anyone can visit the page.

**Example prompt for the HTML step:**

```
Create an HTML page with a contact form that has fields for:
Name, Email, Phone, and Message.

Style it with a clean, modern design.

Save it to file storage collection [YOUR_FILESTORAGE_COLLECTION_ID]
with the filename "contact-form.html"
```

At this point you have a working web page, but the form doesn't submit anywhere yet.

### Step 2: Create the Backend Workflow

Create a second workflow that will receive and process form submissions.

A good technique: paste your HTML into the prompt and ask Pinkfish to build a backend for it.

**Example prompt:**

```
Here is my HTML form page:

[paste your HTML here]

Create a backend that will:
1. Accept all of these form fields as input
2. Save them to the datastore collection [YOUR_DATASTORE_COLLECTION_ID]
3. Return a success message
```

Pinkfish will generate a script that receives the form data and writes it to your datastore.

### Step 3: Publish the Backend and Create an API Trigger

1. **Publish** your backend workflow
2. **Create an API trigger** on the published workflow — this gives you an endpoint URL that your HTML page can submit data to
3. **Copy the API trigger URL**

<Tip>
The API trigger URL includes an embedded API key, so your frontend can call it directly without additional authentication.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Connect the Frontend to the Backend

Go back to your frontend workflow and update the HTML to submit to your backend endpoint.

**Example prompt:**

```
Update my HTML form to submit the form data to this endpoint:
[paste your API trigger URL here]

On success, display a "Thank you! Your submission has been received." message.
On error, display a friendly error message.
```

Run the frontend workflow again to regenerate the HTML with the backend connection.

### Step 5: Test It

1. Visit your file storage URL to see the page
2. Fill out the form and submit
3. Check your datastore collection to verify the data was saved

```

## Tips

- **Build the frontend first**, then use the generated HTML to inform the backend workflow
- **The backend can do more than save data** — it can look up existing records, send emails, trigger other workflows, or return data for the page to display
- **Multiple endpoints**: If your page needs to both read and write data, create separate backend workflows for each (e.g. one to fetch existing data, one to save new data)
- **Signed links with query params**: If you need to pass context to the page (like a customer ID), see [Personalized Web Forms with Signed Links](/how-to/personalized-web-forms) for how to embed parameters in the URL
