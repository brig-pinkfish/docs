## Why use this?

Pinkfish can generate interactive HTML pages — but a single workflow can only produce output, it can't also listen for incoming requests. To build a web page that submits data (like a form), you need two workflows: one that creates the frontend and one that acts as the backend.

## The Key Concept

In Pinkfish, a workflow produces a result. It can't also be a server that receives requests. So you split the work:

| Workflow | Role | What it does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Workflow 1** | Frontend | Generates HTML and saves it to file storage |
| **Workflow 2** | Backend | Receives form submissions via an API trigger and saves data to the datastore |

The frontend HTML submits data to the backend workflow's API endpoint. The backend processes it and returns a response.
