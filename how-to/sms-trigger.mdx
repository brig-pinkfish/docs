## Prerequisites
- A published Automation
- A Twilio account with SMS capabilities

## Steps

### 1. Create an API Trigger
1. Navigate to your published Automation
2. Add a new API Trigger
3. Copy your trigger URL and API key

### 2. Configure Twilio
1. Go to Twilio's SMS configuration console
2. Set the webhook URL using this format:
```
https://pinkfish.app/smsrouter/?url=YOUR_TRIGGER_URL&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
3. Replace `YOUR_TRIGGER_URL` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with the values from step 1

Your Automation will now run whenever an SMS is received by your Twilio number. And you can find the contents of the SMS in the inputs. To see your inputs you can write a simple prompt like `simple script to display the contents of inputs`
