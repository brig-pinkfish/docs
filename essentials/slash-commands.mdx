## Under the hood

When you type a slash command in the majority of cases, it simply adds a preset prompt to the chat entry (which triggers our skill interpreter on the back-end). You can see this prompt by hovering over the badge that is inserted into the chat input. Once you learn the commands, feel free to type them directly without using the slash command. The exceptions are:

* Files

* Multi-step browser automation

In these cases, there is an extra something special that is happening behind the scenes.
