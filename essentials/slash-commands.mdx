### ~200 API Skills

Once you've authenticated in the "Connections" area of Pinkfish, you can use about 200 connected services. Pinkfish has a skill built around each of these services such that you should be able to ask for almost anything these services can do in simple english. From Salesforce to Google Sheets, just ask like you would to a colleague.

### Browser Connection Skill

Once you've created a browser connection in the "Connections" area of Pinkfish, you can use the `/browser connection` skill to select one of your available browser connections. In the same command, you can then request one of the browser automation skills that supports browser connections (scraper or browser session). It'll use the browser connection when starting the remote browser session.

### File Handling Skills

- [**Automation Files**](/essentials/files): Work with files attached to your current automation

  - Process files directly in the code that is generated by your automation. Just mention the file by name.

- [**File Storage (global)**](/slash-commands/filestorage): Access your globally stored files that are available across all automations

Each slash command enhances your automation capabilities in specific ways, allowing you to build more powerful and efficient workflows.

## Under the hood

When you type a slash command in the majority of cases, it simply adds a preset prompt to the chat entry (which triggers our skill interpreter on the back-end). You can see this prompt by hovering over the badge that is inserted into the chat input. Once you learn the commands, feel free to type them directly without using the slash command. The exceptions are:

- Files

- Multi-step browser automation

In these cases, there is an extra something special that is happening behind the scenes.
