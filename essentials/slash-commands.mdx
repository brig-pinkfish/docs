### Browser Connection Skill

Once you've created a browser connection in the "Connections" area of Pinkfish, you can use the `/browser connection` skill to select one of your available browser connections. In the same command, you can then request one of the browser automation skills that supports browser connections (scraper or browser session). It'll use the browser connection when starting the remote browser session.

### File Handling Skills

- [**Workflow Files**](/essentials/files): Work with files attached to your current workflow

  - Process files directly in the code that is generated by your workflow. Just mention the file by name.

- [**File Storage (global)**](/slash-commands/filestorage): Access your globally stored files that are available across all workflows

Each slash command enhances your workflow capabilities in specific ways, allowing you to build more powerful and efficient workflows.

## Under the hood

When you type a slash command in the majority of cases, it simply adds a preset prompt to the chat entry (which triggers our skill interpreter on the back-end). You can see this prompt by hovering over the badge that is inserted into the chat input. Once you learn the commands, feel free to type them directly without using the slash command. The exceptions are:

- Files

- Multi-step browser automation

In these cases, there is an extra something special that is happening behind the scenes.
