## What is the Runs Monitor?

The Runs Monitor is a dashboard that allows you to view, track, and analyze the execution of your Workflows. It provides a comprehensive overview of all the runs (executions) of your Workflows, including their statuses, durations, and other key metrics.

## Key Features of the Runs Monitor

### 1. Run List

- Displays a table of all Workflow runs
- Shows key information like Workflow ID, version, run status, duration, and more
- Allows sorting and filtering of runs

### 2. Date Range Selection

- Enables you to view runs within a specific time frame
- Includes a date picker for easy selection of start and end dates

### 3. Column Customization

- Allows you to show/hide specific columns in the runs table
- Customizable columns include Workflow ID, Version, Name, Run ID, Inputs, Step Count, Started By, Start Time, Status, Steps Completed, and Run Duration

### 4. Filtering and Searching

- Provides a search bar to quickly filter runs based on Workflow ID
- Supports keyboard shortcut ("/") for quick access to the search function

### 5. Detailed Run View

- Clicking on a run opens a sidebar with detailed information about that specific run
- Shows all available data for the selected run

### 6. Real-time Updates

- Includes a loading indicator to show when new data is being fetched
- Displays the total number of runs currently visible

## When to Use the Runs Monitor

### Debugging during build

When you're developing a workflow, especially when you're using triggers, the runs monitor is where you'll go to see what happened after your trigger fired.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes a workflow will start to fail or will fail occasionally. The runs monitor is where you'll go to

- Learn about failures (if you didn't already know)
- See the inputs that were used
- See the result from each step, including success/failure of API calls or browser workflows

### Performance Analysis

If you're trying to optimize a workflow, the runs monitor is where you'll go to see how long it took and how many steps it completed.

### Auditing

If you need to audit what happened in a sequence of workflows or in a sequence of steps, the runs monitor is where you'll go to see the history.

- See when each step started and finished
- See who (or what, in the case of a trigger) started the workflow
- See who the workflow communicated with and what data was sent and received
