## What are Steps?

Steps are the fundamental components of an Automation. Each Step represents a specific action or task within your automation workflow. They are designed to be modular and can be chained together to create complex processes. For anything complex, be sure to create multiple steps; it makes everything simpler. 

## Key Aspects of Steps

### Step Components

Each Step consists of several important elements:

- **Chat**: Your interaction with the AI coding agent who understands your requests and converts into code.
- **Skills**: Specific capabilities that the agent can use to complete the step (available via a slash command)
- **Code**: The actual code that will be executed when the step runs.

### Step Lifecycle

Steps go through several phases during their lifecycle:

1. **Chatting**: Steps are created as you chat with the AI Automation agent.
2. **Coding**: The agent generates code that you then run.
4. **Running**: The step is executed.
5. **Completion**: The step finishes and produces a result. If you're happy with the result, you can move on to the next step where you can refer back to the output you created in a previous step.

## Key Features of Steps

- **Real-time Status Updates**: You can monitor the progress of a step through various stages like coding, bundling, and running.
- **Error Handling**: The system provides detailed error messages if something goes wrong during any phase of the step's lifecycle.
- **Code Visibility**: You can view and potentially edit the code generated for each step.
- **Flexibility**: Steps can be created, updated, and rerun as needed, allowing for iterative development of your automations.

## Why Steps are Important

Steps provide a modular approach to building automations. By breaking down complex processes into individual steps, you can:

- Create more manageable and understandable automations
- Easily modify or troubleshoot specific parts of an automation
- Reuse common actions across different automations
- Monitor and control each part of your automation process with granularity

Understanding how Steps work is key to effectively building and managing your Automations, allowing you to create powerful, flexible, and maintainable automated workflows.
