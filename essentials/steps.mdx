## What are Steps?

Steps are the fundamental components of an Automation. Each Step represents a specific action or task within your automation workflow. They are designed to be modular and can be chained together to create complex processes.

## Key Aspects of Steps

### Types of Steps

While the code doesn't explicitly define different step types, it suggests there are at least two kinds of steps:

1. **Standard Steps**: These are general-purpose steps that can perform a wide variety of tasks.
2. **Browser Steps**: These are likely specialized steps for web automation tasks.

### Step Components

Each Step consists of several important elements:

- **Prompt**: A description or instruction of what the step should do.
- **Agent**: An AI entity assigned to execute the step.
- **Skills**: Specific capabilities that the agent can use to complete the step.
- **Code**: The actual code that will be executed when the step runs.

### Step Lifecycle

Steps go through several phases during their lifecycle:

1. **Creation/Update**: Steps can be created or updated with new instructions.
2. **Coding**: The system generates or updates the code for the step based on the prompt and selected skills.
3. **Bundling**: The code is prepared for execution.
4. **Running**: The step is executed.
5. **Completion**: The step finishes and produces a result.

## How Steps Work

1. **Step Creation**: When you create a step, you provide a prompt describing what you want the step to do. You also select an agent and any relevant skills.

2. **Code Generation**: Based on your prompt, the system generates code for the step. This process involves several stages (coding, bundling) and can be monitored in real-time.

3. **Execution**: When you run a step, the system executes the generated code. This process is also monitored, and you can track its status (running, complete, failed).

4. **Results**: After execution, the step produces a result. This could be data, a modification to a system, or any other output defined by the step's purpose.

## Key Features of Steps

- **Real-time Status Updates**: You can monitor the progress of a step through various stages like coding, bundling, and running.
- **Error Handling**: The system provides detailed error messages if something goes wrong during any phase of the step's lifecycle.
- **Code Visibility**: You can view and potentially edit the code generated for each step.
- **Flexibility**: Steps can be created, updated, and rerun as needed, allowing for iterative development of your automations.

## Why Steps are Important

Steps provide a modular approach to building automations. By breaking down complex processes into individual steps, you can:

- Create more manageable and understandable automations
- Easily modify or troubleshoot specific parts of an automation
- Reuse common actions across different automations
- Monitor and control each part of your automation process with granularity

Understanding how Steps work is key to effectively building and managing your Automations, allowing you to create powerful, flexible, and maintainable automated workflows.
