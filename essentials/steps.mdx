## What are Steps?

Steps are the fundamental building blocks of your Automation. Each Step represents a specific action or task within your workflow. Breaking down complex processes into individual steps makes everything simpler and more manageable.

### First Get Data, Then Process Data
Always break up getting data and processing data into separate steps. 
- Step 1: Get data
- Step 2: Process data

Pinkfish won't know what your data is going to look like until after it's retrieved. So, first retrieve it in one step. Then, process it in another step. This is the golden combination.


### Keep It Simple

Use steps to keep your automations simple and easy to understand.
- Keep each step focused on a single task
- Use the automatic step labeling or add your own labels
- Use step outputs as inputs for subsequent steps
- Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable pieces

### Sample Step Sequences

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Step 1: Gather data (from APIs, files, or user input)
   - Step 2: Process or transform the collected data
   - Step 3: Store the results or send results via email

2. **Analysis**:
   - Step 1: Load and parse data files
   - Step 2: Analyze the parsed data
   - Step 3: Generate reports or visualizations

3. **Integration**:
   - Step 1: Prepare data for external system
   - Step 2: Send data to external API
   - Step 3: Handle and verify the response

4. **Reporting**:
   - Step 1: Collect data from previous steps
   - Step 2: Generate a report or dashboard
   - Step 3: Email the report to stakeholders

## In case you need more convincing

Breaking your automation into multiple steps results in:

- **Easier Testing**: Test and debug each step independently
- **Better Organization**: Keep your automation logic clean and organized
- **Improved Maintenance**: Update specific parts without affecting the whole
- **Clearer Workflow**: Understand and document your process more effectively
- **Reusability**: Share outputs between steps and other automations
