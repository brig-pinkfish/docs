## What are Steps?

Steps are the fundamental building blocks of your Automation. Each Step represents a specific action or task within your workflow. Breaking down complex processes into individual steps makes everything simpler and more manageable.

### Break Down Complex Processes

- Create separate steps for data collection and data processing
- Keep each step focused on a single task
- Use step outputs as inputs for subsequent steps
- Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable pieces

### Common Step Sequences

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Step 1: Gather data (from APIs, files, or user input)
   - Step 2: Process or transform the collected data
   - Step 3: Store the results or send results via email

2. **Analysis**:
   - Step 1: Load and parse data files
   - Step 2: Analyze the parsed data
   - Step 3: Generate reports or visualizations

3. **Integration**:
   - Step 1: Prepare data for external system
   - Step 2: Send data to external API
   - Step 3: Handle and verify the response

4. **Reporting**:
   - Step 1: Collect data from previous steps
   - Step 2: Generate a report or dashboard
   - Step 3: Email the report to stakeholders

## Why Use Multiple Steps?

Breaking your automation into multiple steps provides several benefits:

- **Easier Testing**: Test and debug each step independently
- **Better Organization**: Keep your automation logic clean and organized
- **Improved Maintenance**: Update specific parts without affecting the whole
- **Clearer Workflow**: Understand and document your process more effectively
- **Reusability**: Share outputs between steps and other automations
