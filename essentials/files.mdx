Add resources like documents, data, and other content to your automation workflows. Here's what you need to know:

## The Basics

- Each automation has its own set of files
- Files uploaded to one automation aren't shared with others
- Files are easy to access using the "/" command in your workflow

## How to Use Files

1. **Upload** - Add files directly to your automation
2. **Access** - Type "/" in your workflow to see your available files
3. **Select** - Choose the file you want to use from the slash command autocomplete list

That's all you need to do! Your file will be ready to use in your automation steps. 

Here is an example showing selecting an uploaded file with the slash command (preceeded by another slash command that will extract file contents from a PDF):

### Global File Storage
When you upload a file to your automation, it is only available to that automation. If you want to make a file available to all your automations, you can use the [File Storage](/slash-commands/filestorage) command or the User Interface for "Files" in the left navigation.
- Access shared files across all your automations
- Great for resources you use frequently
- Available through the [File Storage](/slash-commands/filestorage) command

## Alternative File Sources

Besides uploading directly and using global file storage, you can bring files into your automation from popular cloud storage services.

### Cloud Storage
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Box
- Amazon S3



## Key Points to Remember

- Files uploaded directly to an automation stay in that automation only
- Use global File Storage if you need files available across all automations
- The "/" command gives you quick access to all your available files

## Important Limitations

### File Duplicates
- You can upload the same file multiple times
- However, this may cause unpredictable behavior when selecting the file
- Best practice: Delete the previous version before uploading a new copy of the same file

### Generating steps with files 
- When generating steps, the Pinkfish Agent only knows files by their names, not their contents
- This means you cannot:
  - Upload policies and ask to "do XYZ according to my policies"
  - Upload a web design and ask to "generate an app like this"
  - Reference file contents in your step prompt
- The step that is generated *will be able* to retrieve and use the contents of your file - so you can process the file contents as part of your step. 

## Best Practices

1. Use direct uploads for automation-specific files
2. Choose global File Storage for commonly used resources
3. Keep your files organized by using clear, descriptive names
4. Remove old versions before uploading new copies of files
