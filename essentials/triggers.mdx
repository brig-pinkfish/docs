## What are Triggers?

Triggers are mechanisms that determine when and how your Automation should run. They act as the starting point for your automated workflows, initiating the execution of your Automation based on specific conditions or events.

## Types of Triggers

There are two main types of triggers:

1. **Schedule Triggers** (coming soon!): These allow you to run your Automation on a predetermined schedule, similar to setting up a recurring task.

2. **API Endpoint Triggers**: These create a unique API endpoint for your Automation, allowing you to start it on-demand via an HTTP request. See Documentation&#x20;

## Key Features of Triggers

### For All Triggers:

* **Name**: Each trigger has a name for easy identification.

* **Release Version**: Triggers can be associated with specific versions of your Automation, including the option to always use the latest version.

### For API Endpoint Triggers:

* **API Key**: Each API trigger is associated with an API key for security.

* **Endpoint URL**: A unique URL is generated for each API trigger, which you can use to start your Automation.

## How Triggers Work

1. **Creation**: You can add triggers to your Automation after it has been published. This ensures that triggers are associated with a specific, locked-in-time version of your Automation.

2. **Configuration**:

   * For Schedule triggers, you would set up the recurring time pattern.

   * For API triggers, you get a unique endpoint and associated API key.

3. **Activation**: Once set up, triggers become active:

   * Schedule triggers will automatically start your Automation based on the defined schedule.

   * API triggers wait for a request to their unique endpoint, then start the Automation when called.

## Important Concepts

* **Publishing Requirement**: You need to publish your Automation before adding triggers. This ensures that triggers are associated with a specific, stable version of your Automation.

* **Multiple Triggers**: You can have multiple triggers for a single Automation, allowing for various ways to initiate your workflow.

* **API Security**: API triggers use API keys to ensure that only authorized users or systems can initiate your Automation.

* **Version Control**: You can associate triggers with specific versions of your Automation or always use the latest version, providing flexibility in how your Automations evolve.

## Why Triggers are Important

Triggers add flexibility and power to your Automations by allowing them to:

* Run on a schedule without manual intervention

* Integrate with other systems via API calls

* Respond to external events or data changes

* Be part of larger, interconnected workflows

Understanding and effectively using triggers allows you to create more dynamic, responsive, and integrated automated systems, enhancing the overall power and utility of your Automations.
