## Database Types

### Structured Database Tables

- Spreadsheet-like interface with defined columns
- Schema-based validation ensures data consistency
- Inline editing for quick updates
- Perfect for: customer databases, inventory, contact lists, structured records

### Unstructured Databases

- Flexible JSON storage for any data structure
- No schema requirements or validation
- Store strings, numbers, objects, or arrays
- Perfect for: logs, API responses, configuration, dynamic content

## Key Features

- **Structured Tables**: Define columns with types (string, number, boolean, date, select)
- **Inline Editing**: Click cells to edit data directly in spreadsheet view
- **Advanced Search**: Fuzzy, exact, and prefix matching with configurable thresholds
- **Event Triggers**: Automatically start workflows when data changes (onCreate, onEdit, onDelete)
- **Batch Operations**: Create up to 500 items in a single operation
- **Multiple Access Methods**: Access items by key, key+sortField, or unique itemId

## Common Use Cases

**Structured Database Tables:**

- Customer and contact databases
- Product catalogs and inventory management
- Employee records and HR data
- Sales leads and CRM data
- Any data that benefits from defined columns

**Unstructured Databases:**

- Application logs and event tracking
- API response caching
- Configuration and settings
- Dynamic content and JSON storage
- Queue systems and task management
