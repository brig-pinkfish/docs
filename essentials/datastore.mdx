## Database Types

### Structured Database Tables
- Spreadsheet-like interface with defined columns
- Schema-based validation ensures data consistency
- Inline editing for quick updates
- Perfect for: customer databases, inventory, contact lists, structured records

### Unstructured Databases
- Flexible JSON storage for any data structure
- No schema requirements or validation
- Store strings, numbers, objects, or arrays
- Perfect for: logs, API responses, configuration, dynamic content

## Key Features

- **Structured Tables**: Define columns with types (string, number, boolean, date, select)
- **Inline Editing**: Click cells to edit data directly in spreadsheet view
- **Advanced Search**: Fuzzy, exact, and prefix matching with configurable thresholds
- **Event Triggers**: Automatically start workflows when data changes (onCreate, onEdit, onDelete)
- **Batch Operations**: Create up to 500 items in a single operation
- **Multiple Access Methods**: Access items by key, key+sortField, or unique itemId

## Common Use Cases

**Structured Database Tables:**
- Customer and contact databases
- Product catalogs and inventory management
- Employee records and HR data
- Sales leads and CRM data
- Any data that benefits from defined columns

**Unstructured Databases:**
- Application logs and event tracking
- API response caching
- Configuration and settings
- Dynamic content and JSON storage
- Queue systems and task management

## Using with Workflows

Select a data collection from the slash command menu to automatically preset the collection ID. This gives you access to all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, search) plus advanced features like pagination and triggers.

For complete usage details, examples, and API reference, see the [Datastore slash command documentation](/slash-commands/datastore).
