## Data Collections

Data Collections help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

When working with Data Collections, you can:

- Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
- View items in either document or table format based on their structure
- Easily reference collections in workflow workflows
- Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
- Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously

## Sharing Collections

Data collections can be shared with specific team members or your entire organization. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a data collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and items within it into your code.

For more details on using the Datastore feature in workflows, see the [Datastore slash command documentation](/slash-commands/datastore).
