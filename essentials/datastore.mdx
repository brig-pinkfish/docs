The Datastore feature allows you to store and organize data items within Pinkfish, providing a centralized location for managing structured information used in your workflows.

## Data Collections

Data Collections help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

When working with Data Collections, you can:

- Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
- View items in either document or table format based on their structure
- Easily reference collections in workflow workflows
- Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
- Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously

## Creating and Managing Collections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Datastore">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Click the "+" or "New Collection" button to create a new data collection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Configure">
    Provide a name and configure any collection-specific settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Items">
    Add existing data items to your collection or create new ones directly within it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Access">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sharing Collections

Data collections can be shared with specific team members or your entire organization. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a data collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and items within it into your code.

For more details on using the Datastore feature in workflows, see the [Datastore slash command documentation](/slash-commands/datastore).
