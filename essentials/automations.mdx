## What are Automations?

Automations are versatile, multi-step workflows that allow you to automate complex tasks and processes. They are the core building blocks of your work with the Automation Engineer, enabling you to create sophisticated sequences of actions that can interact with various systems and data sources.

## Key Components of an Automation

### Steps

An Automation consists of one or more steps. Each step represents a specific action or task in your workflow. Use steps to break up complicated workflows into smaller and simpler bits.

### Skills&#x20;

Within a step, you can make use of various skills. Skills are capabilities that Pinkfish has been trained to do.

### Files

Automations can work with files, allowing you to upload, process, and manipulate data from various file formats as part of your workflow.

### Triggers

Automations can be set up with triggers, which determine when and how the Automation should run. There are two types of triggers:

1. **Schedule Triggers**: Allow you to run Automations on a predetermined schedule using cron expressions.

2. **API Endpoint Triggers**: Enable you to start Automations via API calls, making it possible to integrate them with other systems.

## What Can Automations Do?

Automations are incredibly flexible and can be used for a wide range of tasks:

* **Data Processing**: Extract, transform, and load data from various sources.

* **Web Scraping**: Automatically collect data from websites.

* **Workflow Automation**: Streamline business processes by automating repetitive tasks.

* **Integration**: Connect different systems and applications to work together seamlessly.

* **Reporting**: Generate automated reports by collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources.

* **Content Creation**: Assist in creating content by gathering information and formatting it as needed.

## Building and Managing Automations

You can create and edit Automations through an intuitive interface. This includes:

* Adding and organizing steps

* Specifying instructions for each step

* Managing files associated with the Automation

* Setting up triggers for automatic execution

* Running individual steps or the entire Automation

* Viewing results and debugging information

Automations can also be versioned and released, allowing you to manage changes and maintain different versions of your workflows over time.
