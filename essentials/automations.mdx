## What are Workflows?

Workflows are versatile, multi-step workflows that allow you to automate complex tasks and processes. They are the core building blocks of your work with the Workflow Engineer, enabling you to create sophisticated sequences of actions that can interact with various systems and data sources.

## Key Components of a Workflow

### Steps

A Workflow consists of one or more steps. Each step represents a specific action or task in your workflow. Use steps to break up complicated workflows into smaller and simpler bits.

### Skills&#x20;

Within a step, you can make use of various skills. Skills are capabilities that Pinkfish has been trained to do. For example, you can use any of the leading LLM skills, or image processing skill, or Connection skill to your favorite SaaS service. Access skills via the Slash command in the prompt input box.

### Files

Workflows can work with files, allowing you to upload, process, and manipulate data from various file formats as part of your workflow.

### Triggers

Workflows can be set up with triggers, which determine when and how the Workflow should run. There are two types of triggers:

1. **Schedule Triggers**: Allow you to run Workflows on a predetermined schedule using cron expressions.

2. **API Endpoint Triggers**: Enable you to start Workflows via API calls, making it possible to integrate them with other systems.

## What Can Workflows Do?

Workflows are incredibly flexible and can be used for a wide range of tasks:

- **Data Processing**: Extract, transform, and load data from various sources.

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically collect data from websites.

- **Workflow Automation**: Streamline business processes by automating repetitive tasks.

- **Integration**: Connect different systems and applications to work together seamlessly.

- **Reporting**: Generate automated reports by collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources.

- **Content Creation**: Assist in creating content by gathering information and formatting it as needed.

## Building and Managing Workflows

You can create and edit Workflows through an intuitive interface. This includes:

- Adding and organizing steps

- Specifying instructions for each step

- Managing files associated with the Workflow

- Setting up triggers for automatic execution

- Running individual steps or the entire Workflow

- Viewing results and debugging information

Workflows can also be versioned and released, allowing you to manage changes and maintain different versions of your workflows over time.
