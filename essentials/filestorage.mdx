The File Storage feature provides an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's system, helping you manage various types of files used in your workflows.

## File Collections

File Collections provide an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's File Storage system. They help you manage various types of files used in your workflows.

File Collections enable you to:

- Group related files such as templates, configurations, or documentation
- Maintain version history across collection items
- Apply consistent metadata and access controls to files
- Reference file collections in your workflows
- Share sets of files with appropriate access permissions

## Creating and Managing Collections

<Caution>
  When uploading files to collections, ensure you have appropriate permissions and are not uploading sensitive or proprietary information without proper authorization.
</Caution>

## Sharing Collections

File collections can be shared with specific team members or your entire organization. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a file collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and the files within it into your code.

For more details on using the File Storage feature in workflows, see the [File Storage slash command documentation](/slash-commands/filestorage).
