It covers many of the concepts and terminology you would come across when managing or working within a Pinkfish organization. After reading this page, you should have a good understanding of the fundamentals for organizations users."

## **Organization**

A **Pinkfish Organization** (commonly referred to as an _Org_) is a distinct, self-contained workspace. Each Org includes:

- Its own set of **users** along with user role and access control
- Its own **settings** that includes usage, billing and more
- Its own **content** such as automations, connections, vault items, file store, and data stores

Depending on the subscription edition, each organization may have access to different features and usage limits. You can find a detailed breakdown of features by edition

## **Users**

A _user_ has access to the organization. Users represent the people with access to the organization and its data. Pinkfish uses email addresses as the identifier for users. In some cases, a user can have access to more than one organization.

- When someone creates an org for the first time, that user becomes the admin for that org and will have the ability to give that org a name. The admin will be able to invite other users to the org, if the org subscription edition supports that.
- _Note_: Currently, admin can only invite users that have already signed up to Pinkfish. With this, each user would have 2 orgs, a default org and the invites org. We have in our roadmap to eliminate this and provide the ability to invite a non-pinkfish user to sign up for the first time directly into the invited org.

## **Roles**

User can have 2 roles: Admin & Member

| User Role | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| Admin | Users with the **Admin** role have the following capabilities: |
| | **1. User Management**: Add, edit, and remove users within the organization. |
| | **2. Organization Management**: Edit the organization name and, depending on the subscription edition, create and manage multiple organizations. |
| | **3. Billing & Usage Access**: View usage details and manage billing. Admins can pay directly through the platform or, for enterprise plans, opt for invoice-based billing. |
| | **4. Access to Shared Content**: Connections, automations, data store, file store and vault that have been shared with them. |
| Member | Users in the **Member** group have Access to Shared Content: connections, automations, data store, file store and vault that have been shared with them. This is a default group that will be applied to every user. |

## **Sharing Permissions**

Every entity within Pinfkish can be shared. Currently Connections and Automations can be shared easily within an organization. In the future, we will enable data store, file store and vault to be shared. Here is how the sharing permissions work.

| **Resource**                   | **Permission** | **_What the User Can Do_**                                        | **_What the User Cannot Do_**            |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**                 | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share automation; manage triggers and API keys | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | View automation                                                   | Cannot edit, delete, run, or share       |
| **Connection**                 | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share connection                               | —                                        |
|                                | **Run**        | Use connection in automations                                     | Cannot edit, delete, or share connection |
| **Data Store** _(Coming Soon)_ | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Share data store collection                         | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from data store in automations                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |

|                                | **View**       | Read from file store in automations                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |
| **Vault** _(Coming Soon)_      | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Share vault collection                              | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from vault in automations                                    | Cannot edit, delete, or share            |

## **Multiple Organization Management**

### Organization Switching

Depending on the subscription edition, some users may have access to multiple organizations linked to the same email address. These organizations could represent different environments (e.g., production and staging) or separate business units (e.g., Business Unit 1 and Business Unit 2) or different customers (e.g., Customer 1 and Customer 2) etc

In such cases, users can switch between organizations by selecting the org name from the top-right menu and navigating to the organization management page. If a user belongs to only one organization, the option to switch organizations will not be displayed.

### Organization Creation

Depending on the subscription level, a customer may have the ability to create and manage multiple organizations. When this is enabled, users can click on the organization name in the top-right corner and navigate to the organization management page to switch between existing organizations or create a new one.
