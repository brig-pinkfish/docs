## What are Skills?

Skills are specific abilities or areas of expertise that an Automation Agent can use to complete tasks. They represent specialized knowledge or capabilities that can be applied to various steps within an Automation.

## Key Aspects of Skills

### Skill Suggestion System

The Automation platform includes a sophisticated system for suggesting relevant Skills:

1. **Typeahead Suggestions**: As you type in a step's instructions, the system suggests Skills that might be relevant based on what you're writing.

2. **File Integration**: The suggestion system also integrates with files associated with your Automation, allowing you to easily reference and use files in your steps.

3. **Exact Matching**: The system can identify when you've explicitly mentioned a Skill by its exact name or ID.

## How Skills Work

1. **Skill Association**: Skills are associated with specific Agents. Each Agent has a set of Skills it can use.

2. **Automatic Detection**: As you write instructions for a step, the system automatically detects mentions of Skills or situations where a Skill might be useful.

3. **Suggestion**: The system suggests relevant Skills based on your input, helping you leverage the full capabilities of your Agents.

4. **Application**: When a Skill is applied to a step, it enhances the Agent's ability to complete that specific task.

## Key Features of the Skill System

- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Skills are suggested in real-time as you type, making it easy to discover and use relevant capabilities.

## Why Skills are Important

Skills are crucial to the effectiveness and flexibility of your Automations:

- They allow Agents to perform specialized tasks efficiently.
- They make it easier to create complex Automations by breaking tasks into specific capabilities.
- The suggestion system helps users discover and utilize the full range of available capabilities.
- Skills can be updated and improved over time, enhancing the overall capabilities of your Automation system.

## Available Skills

Here's a list of some key skills available in the system:

1. **Scraping**
   Description: Scraping is the process of extracting data from a website. This can be useful for various purposes, such as data analysis, content aggregation, or monitoring.

2. **Process Form**
   Description: Extract data from a scanned form.

3. **Inputs**
   Description: For specifying where to find input parameters.

4. **Claude**
   Description: Our internal data processing agent that helps you summarize, categorize, classify and much more.

5. **Gemini**
   Description: Our internal data processing agent that helps you summarize, categorize, classify and many more.

These skills cover a range of capabilities from data extraction (scraping and form processing) to input handling and advanced data processing using AI agents (Claude and Gemini). Each skill has a specific purpose and can be applied in various automation scenarios depending on the task at hand.
