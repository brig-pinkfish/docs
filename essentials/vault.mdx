The Vault feature provides secure storage for credentials and sensitive information used across your workflows, with fine-grained access controls to protect your most sensitive data.

## Vault Collections

Vault Collections help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your workflows.

With Vault Collections, you can:

- Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
- Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
- Reference entire collections of secrets in workflow workflows
- Rotate credentials across collections when needed
- Maintain clear separation between different security contexts

## Creating and Managing Collections

<Warning>
  Be extremely cautious when working with vault collections. Always follow security best practices and never store sensitive information in plain text outside of the vault.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Vault">
    Navigate to the main header menu and select the Vault section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Click the "+" or "New Collection" button to create a new vault collection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Configure">
    Provide a name and configure security settings for the collection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Secrets">
    Add existing secrets to your collection or create new ones directly within it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Access">
    Configure strict permissions to control who can view or edit the collection
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sharing Collections

<Warning>
  Be extremely cautious when sharing vault collections. Only share with trusted team members who require access, and always apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access permissions.
</Warning>

Vault collections can be shared with specific team members, but should never be shared with the entire organization unless absolutely necessary. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a vault collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and the secrets within it into your code.

For more details on using the Vault feature in workflows, see the [Get Secret slash command documentation](/slash-commands/get-secret).
