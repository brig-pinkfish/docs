The Vault feature provides secure, encrypted storage for credentials and sensitive information used across your workflows. Store API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data in encrypted collections without exposing them in your code. All secrets are encrypted at rest and only decrypted when accessed by authorized workflows.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: All secrets are encrypted at rest for maximum security
- **Collection-Based Organization**: Group related secrets into secure collections
- **JSON Support**: Store complex objects and nested data structures as secrets
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions for viewing and editing secrets
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly retrieve secrets without hardcoding values
- **Audit Trail**: Track access patterns and usage across your workflows

## Common Use Cases

- API key and token management for third-party services
- Database credentials and connection strings
- Authentication secrets for external systems
- Environment-specific configuration values
- Shared credentials for team workflows

## Vault Collections

Vault Collections help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your workflows.

With Vault Collections, you can:

- Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
- Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
- Reference entire collections of secrets in workflow workflows
- Rotate credentials across collections when needed
- Maintain clear separation between different security contexts

## Sharing Collections

<Warning>
  Be extremely cautious when sharing vault collections. Only share with trusted team members who require access, and always apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access permissions.
</Warning>

Vault collections can be shared with specific team members, but should never be shared with the entire organization unless absolutely necessary. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a vault collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and the secrets within it into your code.

For more details on using the Vault feature in workflows, see the [Get Secret slash command documentation](/slash-commands/get-secret).
