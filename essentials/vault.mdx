## What is Vault?

Vault is Pinkfish's secure storage system for retrieving encrypted secrets and inserting them into your step code or browser automations. It's perfect for storing and accessing sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and API keys.

With Vault, you can safely store sensitive information and reference it in your automations without exposing the actual values in your code. However, Vault alone cannot handle scenarios that require 2FA (two-factor authentication) or CAPTCHA solving. For these cases, you have two better options:

1. **Browser Connections**: For browser-based automations that require 2FA/CAPTCHA, use Browser Connections to maintain an authenticated session.
2. **API Connections**: For services that offer API access, use API Connections to bypass browser authentication entirely.

For example, while you could store Salesforce credentials in Vault, you'd want to use Browser Connections if your Salesforce instance requires 2FA, or API Connections if you're performing actions that can be done through Salesforce's API.

### Using Vault

You can access your stored Vault items using the `/get-secret` command. Here's an example of how to use a stored Salesforce login in an automation:

```
/get-secret salesforceLogin
/scraper
* goto https://YOURCOMPANY.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home
- fill username input with username from secret
- fill password input with password from secret
- click "login" button
```

In this example, the automation retrieves the stored credentials and uses them to log into Salesforce. The actual username and password values are never exposed in the automation code.

### Storing Items in Vault

You can store new items in Vault through the Pinkfish web interface:

1. Navigate to the Vault section
2. Click the "+" button to add a new item
3. Enter a key name (e.g., "salesforceLogin")
4. Add your sensitive data in the content field
5. Save the item

Your stored items can include multiple fields. For example, a single Vault item might contain:
```json
{
    "username": "myuser@company.com",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "apiKey": "abc123",
    "customField": "custom value"
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Vault items are encrypted at rest and only decrypted when needed by your automations
- Credentials are never exposed in your automation code or logs
- Access to Vault items requires proper authentication
- You can rotate or update stored credentials without modifying your automations

### Best Practices

1. Use descriptive key names that indicate the purpose of the stored item
2. Store related credentials (like username/password pairs) in the same Vault item
3. Regularly review and update your stored credentials
4. Never hardcode sensitive information in your automations - always use Vault references
