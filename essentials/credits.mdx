Pinkfish provides a comprehensive automation platform with included resources at every subscription level. Credits are a flexible way to extend your automations with built-in value added services. Credits are only needed for these optional premium services that extend capabilities beyond what is included in the platform.

## Included

The following platform services do not require credits: 

- Code generation 
- Automation runs
- Automations
- Triggers
- Datastore
- Filestorage 
- Monitor

For a detailed breakdown of the specific limits and allocations for each subscription tier, please refer to our [Limits](/essentials/limits) documentation.

## What are Credits?

Credits in Pinkfish provide access to optional premium services that extend your platform's capabilities. They're only consumed when you use specific value-added services beyond your included resources:

- **AI Services**: Credits fund AI language models, document processing, and other intelligent services
- **Browser Automation**: Credits pay for browser-based operations and scraping capabilities
- **Media Processing**: Credits enable image generation, background removal, and document processing
- **Advanced Integrations**: Credits fund specialized third-party service integrations 

For a complete list of features available on each plan and the resource limits that apply, see our [Limits](/essentials/limits) documentation.

## Credit Allocation by Plan

Each Pinkfish subscription includes a specific credit allocation for value-added services:

### Credit Allocation Policy

- **Starter Plan**: Includes 1,000 free credits for the 30-day trial period
- **Monthly Plans**: Credits are allocated at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle
- **Annual Plans**: Credits for the entire year are allocated upfront at the start of your subscription
- **Usage Tracking**: All credit usage is monitored against your total allocation

### Graduated Pricing for Additional Credits

When you use more credits than included in your plan, you'll benefit from our tiered pricing model:
- Tiered graduated pricing - gets cheaper the more you use starting at $0.004/credit
- Pay only for what you actually use beyond your included credits
- Volume-based discounts automatically applied as usage increases
