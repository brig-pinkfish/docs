# Credits System

Pinkfish provides a comprehensive automation platform with extensive included resources at every subscription level, and each subscription includes **unlimited usage of core platform features**. Credits are a flexible way to access additional value-added services beyond your plan's already generous inclusions.

Credits are only needed for optional premium services that extend your platform's capabilities.

## Platform Inclusions

Every Pinkfish subscription includes an extensive set of core resources at no additional cost:

- Unlimited code generations
- Unlimited automation runs
- Unlimited automations
- Unlimited email, API, and scheduled triggers
- Unlimited integration connections (except custom)
- Multiple Datastore collections
- Multiple File Storage collections
- Vault collections
- Browser-operator logins
- Automation concurrency

For a detailed breakdown of the specific limits and allocations for each subscription tier, please refer to our [Limits](/essentials/limits) documentation.

## What are Credits?

Credits in Pinkfish provide access to optional premium services that extend your platform's capabilities. They're only consumed when you use specific value-added services beyond your included resources:

- **AI Services**: Credits fund AI language models, document processing, and other intelligent services
- **Browser Automation**: Credits pay for browser-based operations and scraping capabilities
- **Media Processing**: Credits enable image generation, background removal, and document processing
- **Advanced Integrations**: Credits fund specialized third-party service integrations

The credit system allows you to:
- Access premium features only when you need them
- Pay only for the advanced services you actually use
- Scale usage up or down based on your requirements
- Leverage our usage-based pricing to reduce costs as volume increases

## Optional Value-Added Services

With credits, you can enhance your automations with premium capabilities:

- LLM calls (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- Advanced API integrations
- Browser operator actions (max 5 concurrent)
- Specialized email services
- Web scraping
- Image generation and manipulation
- Document processing
- Web searching
- OCR
- Transcription
- Translation
- And more specialized services

For a complete list of features available on each plan and the resource limits that apply, see our [Limits](/essentials/limits) documentation.

## Credit Allocation by Plan

Each Pinkfish subscription includes a specific credit allocation for value-added services:

### Credit Allocation Policy

- **Starter Plan**: Includes 1,000 free credits for the 30-day trial period
- **Monthly Plans**: Credits are allocated at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle
- **Annual Plans**: Credits for the entire year are allocated upfront at the start of your subscription
- **Usage Tracking**: All credit usage is monitored against your total allocation

### Monthly Plans

Our usage-based pricing model includes a generous allocation of credits with each plan to use with value-added services. After using your included credits, you'll benefit from tiered graduated pricing â€” **the more you use, the less expensive each additional credit becomes.**

**Included credits per month:**
- **Starter Plan**: 1,000 credits (30-day trial only)
- **Pro Plan**: 5,000 credits 
- **Team Plan**: 25,000 credits

After using your included credits, additional usage is billed at graduated rates that decrease as your volume increases, ensuring you get the best value as you scale.

### Annual Plans

Annual plans provide all included credits allocated upfront for the entire year with significant savings. These plans offer the same usage-based model with tiered pricing for additional usage, but with all included credits available immediately for maximum flexibility.

**Included credits per year:**
- **Pro Plan**: 60,000 credits
- **Team Plan**: 300,000 credits

Annual subscribers benefit from both upfront allocation and the ability to use credits flexibly throughout the year, with the same graduated pricing for any additional usage.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: unlimited access to core platform features, plus flexible usage-based pricing for premium services that gets more economical as your volume increases.
