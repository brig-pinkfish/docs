# Credits System
Credits are used for value-added services within our platform, giving you access to advanced capabilities like AI processing, browser automation, and external integrations. Understanding how credits work helps you maximize the value of these premium features.

<Info>
Credits apply only to specific value-added services, while many core platform features remain available at no credit cost. This flexibility lets you predict and control spending on advanced capabilities while freely using basic platform functionality.

## What are Credits?
Credits in Pinkfish are a flexible way to access premium computational resources and advanced features. They're only consumed when you use specific value-added services:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Services" icon="brain">
    Credits fund AI language models, document processing, and other intelligent services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser Automation" icon="browser">
    Credits pay for browser-based operations and scraping capabilities  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Premium Storage" icon="database">
    Credits may be used for certain storage operations beyond basic limits
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Services" icon="plug">
    Credits enable integrations with third-party services and APIs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The credit system allows you to:
- Access premium features only when you need them
- Scale usage up or down based on your requirements
- Pay only for the advanced services you actually use
- Enjoy many platform features at no credit cost
- Distribute resources efficiently across your organization

## Credit Allocation by Plan
Each Pinkfish subscription plan includes a specific credit allocation designed to meet different usage needs:

### Credit Allocation Policy
    - **Starter Plan**: Includes 1,000 credits with free trial
    - **Monthly Plans**: Credits are allocated at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle
    - **Annual Plans**: All credits for the entire year are allocated upfront at the start of your subscription
    - **Credit Availability**: Monthly included credits are available for the month, while annual included credits are available for the entire year
    - **Usage Tracking**: All credit usage is monitored against your total allocation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly Plans">
    Our usage-based pricing model includes a generous allocation of credits with each plan. As your usage increases beyond these included credits, you'll benefit from tiered graduated pricing—the more you use, the less expensive each additional credit becomes.
    
    **Included credits per month:**
    - **Starter Plan**: 1,000 credits (Free trial)
    - **Pro Tier 1**: 5,000 credits included 
    - **Pro Tier 2**: 20,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 3**: 100,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 1**: 100,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 2**: 500,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 3**: 1,000,000 credits included
    
    After using your included credits, additional usage is billed at graduated rates that decrease as your volume increases, ensuring you get the best value as you scale.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Annual Plans">
    <Note>All included credits allocated upfront for the entire year with significant savings</Note>
    
    Annual plans provide the same usage-based model with tiered pricing for additional usage, but with all included credits available immediately for maximum flexibility.
    
    **Included credits per year:**
    - **Pro Tier 1**: 60,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 2**: 240,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 3**: 1,200,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 1**: 1,200,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 2**: 6,000,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 3**: 12,000,000 credits included
    
    Annual subscribers benefit from both upfront allocation and the ability to use credits flexibly throughout the year, with the same graduated pricing for any additional usage.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: predictable costs with included credits for experimentation and regular usage, plus the flexibility of usage-based pricing that gets more economical as your volume increases.

    - 150 credits (30 credits per minute × 5 minutes)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Document Processing">
    Processing a 15-page document with Doc AI would cost:
    - 600 credits (40 credits per page × 15 pages)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Combined Workflow">
    A typical workflow that combines multiple services could consume credits as follows:
    - OpenAI processing (5,000 tokens): 50 credits
    - Browser automation (2 minutes): 60 credits
    - Data storage operations (10 requests): 50 credits

## Monitoring Credit Usage
Pinkfish provides tools to help you track and manage your credit consumption:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View dashboard">
    Access your Pinkfish dashboard to see your current credit usage and allocation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check detailed reports">
    Navigate to the Usage section to view detailed breakdowns by service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor trends">
    Review historical usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up alerts">
    Configure notifications to stay informed about your credit usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Credit Alerts and Notifications
Stay informed about your credit usage with automated alerts:

- **Threshold Notifications**: Get alerted when your usage reaches specified percentages of your included credits
- **Usage Notifications**: Receive notifications when you're approaching your included credit limit
- **Usage-Based Billing Alerts**: Be notified when your usage exceeds your included credits and additional usage-based billing begins
- **Forecast Warnings**: Get predictive alerts based on usage trends

## Usage-Based Billing
When you use more credits than included in your plan, our usage-based billing ensures your automations continue running without interruption:

<Warning>
As you use more than your included credits, you'll be billed for additional usage. Set up proper monitoring and alerts to manage your usage effectively.
</Warning>

### How Usage-Based Billing Works
- Your subscription includes a set number of credits each billing cycle
- Additional credits used beyond your included amount are billed at usage-based rates
- You only pay for the additional resources you actually use
- Billing for additional usage occurs at the end of your billing cycle

### Managing Your Usage
- Set credit limits to control your usage-based spending
- Configure automations to notify you when approaching usage thresholds
- Receive timely notifications about your credit consumption
- Upgrade to a plan with more included credits if you consistently need more resources
