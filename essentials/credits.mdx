## Credit Allocation by Plan

Each Pinkfish subscription includes a specific credit allocation for value-added services:

### Credit Allocation Policy
- **Free Tier**: Includes a monthly allocation of free credits for experimentation
- **Monthly Plans**: Credits are allocated at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle
- **Annual Plans**: All credits for the entire year are allocated upfront at the start of your subscription
- **Usage Tracking**: All credit usage is monitored against your total allocation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly Plans">
    Our usage-based pricing model includes a generous allocation of credits with each plan to use with value-added services. After using your included credits, you'll benefit from tiered graduated pricingâ€”the more you use, the less expensive each additional credit becomes.
    
    **Included credits per month:**
    - **Starter Plan**: 1,000 credits (Free trial)
    - **Pro Tier 1**: 5,000 credits included 
    - **Pro Tier 2**: 20,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 3**: 100,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 1**: 100,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 2**: 500,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 3**: 1,000,000 credits included
    
    After using your included credits, additional usage is billed at graduated rates that decrease as your volume increases, ensuring you get the best value as you scale.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Annual Plans">
    <Note>All included credits allocated upfront for the entire year with significant savings</Note>
    
    Annual plans provide the same usage-based model with tiered pricing for additional usage, but with all included credits available immediately for maximum flexibility.
    
    **Included credits per year:**
    - **Pro Tier 1**: 60,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 2**: 240,000 credits included
    - **Pro Tier 3**: 1,200,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 1**: 1,200,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 2**: 6,000,000 credits included
    - **Team Tier 3**: 12,000,000 credits included
    
    Annual subscribers benefit from both upfront allocation and the ability to use credits flexibly throughout the year, with the same graduated pricing for any additional usage.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: unlimited access to core platform features, plus flexible usage-based pricing for premium services that gets more economical as your volume increases.
