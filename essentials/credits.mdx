# Credits System
Credits are the primary currency within our platform, powering your ability to execute automations, process data, and utilize platform features. Understanding how credits work is essential for managing your usage effectively.

<Info>
Credits represent computational resources used to run your automations and execute various platform operations. They provide a predictable way to measure and manage your platform usage.

## What are Credits?
Credits in Pinkfish represent computational resources used to run your automations and execute various platform operations. They provide a flexible way to measure and manage usage across different features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Execution Resources" icon="play">
    Credits pay for the computational time and resources used when running automations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage Usage" icon="database">
    Credits may be allocated for storage usage across Datastore, File Storage, and Vault
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Operations" icon="code">
    Credits fund API calls and interactions with external services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special Features" icon="star">
    Some advanced features may require additional credit allocation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The credit system allows you to:
- Predict costs based on your usage patterns

### Calculation Methods
Credits are calculated using different methods depending on the service:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Per Request" icon="network-wired">
    A fixed number of credits for each API call or operation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per Token" icon="message">
    Credits based on the number of tokens processed by language models
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per Minute" icon="clock">
    Time-based billing for services that run continuously

### Credit Consumption Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Language Models">
    When using language models to generate text or process content:
    - Processing 10,000 tokens with Claude would cost 200 credits (20 credits per 1K tokens)
    - Processing 10,000 tokens with Gemini would cost 50 credits (5 credits per 1K tokens)
    - Processing 10,000 tokens with OpenAI would cost 100 credits (10 credits per 1K tokens)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Browser Automation">
    A browser automation that runs for 5 minutes would consume:
    - 150 credits (30 credits per minute × 5 minutes)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Document Processing">
    Processing a 15-page document with Doc AI would cost:
    - 600 credits (40 credits per page × 15 pages)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Combined Workflow">
    A typical workflow that combines multiple services could consume credits as follows:
    - OpenAI processing (5,000 tokens): 50 credits
    - Browser automation (2 minutes): 60 credits
    - Data storage operations (10 requests): 50 credits
    - Email notification: 10 credits
    - Total: 170 credits
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Free Services
Some services are provided at no credit cost:
- Basic automation runs (RUN service)

## Monitoring Credit Usage
Pinkfish provides tools to help you track and manage your credit consumption:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View dashboard">
    Access your Pinkfish dashboard to see your current credit usage and allocation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check detailed reports">
    Navigate to the Usage section to view detailed breakdowns by service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor trends">
    Review historical usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up alerts">
    Configure notifications to stay informed about your credit usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Credit Alerts and Notifications
Stay informed about your credit usage with automated alerts:

- **Threshold Notifications**: Get alerted when your usage reaches specified percentages of your allocation
- **Low Balance Warnings**: Receive notifications when credits are running low
- **Overage Alerts**: Be notified when your usage exceeds your plan allocation
- **Forecast Warnings**: Get predictive alerts based on usage trends

## Overage Credits and Billing
When you exceed your plan's credit allocation, overage billing ensures your automations continue running without interruption:

<Warning>
Exceeding your credit allocation will result in overage charges. Set up proper monitoring and alerts to avoid unexpected billing.
</Warning>

### How Overage Works
- Credits used beyond your plan's allocation are billed as overage
- Overage rates depend on your subscription plan
- Billing occurs at the end of your billing cycle

### Controlling Overage
- Set credit limits to prevent unexpected overages
- Configure automations to pause when credit thresholds are reached
- Receive notifications before overages occur
