# Automation Sharing
Share automations with team members and your organization to enable better collaboration.

## What is Sharing?
Automation sharing allows you to give other users or your entire organization access to automations you've created. This feature enables team collaboration, knowledge sharing, and more efficient workflow management across your organization.

**Sharing is different from Duplicating**
Sharing an automation gives another person (or everyone in your organization) access to your automation. When shared, a change made by one person will affect all users who have access to the automation. Duplication creates a copy of the automation in either your current organization or another organization to which you have access. 


**What are the steps?**
Simply navigate to the Automations Library in your Pinkfish dashboard, and select the automation you wish to share. Click the options menu (â‹®) in the upper right corner of that automation and select "Share". A confirmation modal will appear allowing you to who you are intending to share this automationwith. Either a single, or group of Individuals, or to your entire organization. When you have made your selections, click **Share**.

## Sharing Options:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Add users in the **Add People** section. It will autocomplete based on the email addresses in the organization.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Share with an entire organization by selecting **General Access**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Set permission levels for each user or organization

## Permission Levels

When sharing an automation, you can assign different levels of access:

- **VIEW**: Users can view and run the automation but cannot modify it
- **EDIT**: Users can view, run, edit, and manage sharing permissions for the automation
