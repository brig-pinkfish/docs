**Sharing is different from Duplicating**
Sharing a workflow gives another person (or everyone in your organization) access to your workflow. When shared, a change made by one person will affect all users who have access to the workflow. Duplication however, creates a copy of the workflow in either your current organization or another organization to which you have access.

## Sharing Permissions

Every entity within Pinkfish can be shared. Currently Connections and Workflows can be shared easily within an organization. In the future, we will enable data store, file store and vault to be shared. Here is how the sharing permissions work.

| **Resource**                   | **Permission** | **_What the User Can Do_**                                      | **_What the User Cannot Do_**            |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow**                   | **Manage**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share workflow; manage triggers and API keys | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | View workflow                                                   | Cannot edit, delete, run, or share       |
| **Connection**                 | **Manage**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share connection                             | —                                        |
|                                | **Run**        | Use connection in workflows                                     | Cannot edit, delete, or share connection |
| **Data Store** _(Coming Soon)_ | **Manage**       | Edit, Delete, Share data store collection                       | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from data store in workflows                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |
| **File Store** _(Coming Soon)_ | **Manage**       | Edit, Delete, Share file store collection                       | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from file store in workflows                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |
| **Vault** _(Coming Soon)_      | **Manage**       | Edit, Delete, Share vault collection                            | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from vault in workflows                                    | Cannot edit, delete, or share            |

## Sharing your workflows

Simply navigate to the `Library` menu item on the left side of your Pinkfish dashboard. Once there click the `Share` icon from the Action column. Alternatively you can open the workflow you wish to share and click the options menu (⋮) in the upper right corner of that workflow and select `Share` from the dropdown menu.

Next a confirmation modal will appear allowing you to choose who you are intending to share this workflow with and their permission level. Either for a single, or group of individuals, or to your entire organization.

#### Sharing Options:

- Share with users individually in the **Add People** section. It will autocomplete based on email addresses for the organization.
- Share with an entire organization by selecting **General Access**
- Set permission levels for each user or organization
  - **View**: Users can view the workflow, but cannot run or modify it
  - **Edit**: Users can view, run, edit, and manage sharing permissions for the workflow
- Click `Share` to apply the settings, and the specified userswill immediately gain access to the workflow at the specified permission level.

### Managing Shared Access

To modify or revoke sharing permissions, first navigate to the workflow's sharing settings. From there, you can adjust permission levels for individual users or the entire organization as needed. If you want to remove access completely simply click the dropdown menu arrow next to a user's permission, or the General Access dropdown arrow next to the organization. Finally, apply your changes to update the permissions using the `Share` button.

#### Individual vs. Organization permissions

- Individual user permissions take precedence over organization-wide permissions
- If a user has individual **Edit** access, they retain this access even if organization-wide access is set to **View**
- Organization-wide permissions apply to all current and future members of your organization

**Important notes about workflow sharing specific to permission levels:**

- Workflow can not be shared with users who exist outside of your organization.
- If an individual user with **Edit** access deletes a workflow, the workflow will be removed from everyone's library who has access to it.
- Since shared workflows are meant to be a collaboration tool, if multiple users who have access attempt to make changes to the workflow at the same time, a race condition will occur. In which the last user to save will overwrite the changes made by the others.

#### Access Control

Access to shared workflows follows these rules:

- Users must be explicitly granted access or be members of an organization with access
- Members of different organizations cannot access the workflow unless specifically granted access
- The access level (**View** or **Edit**) determines what actions users can take with the shared workflow
- Only users with **Edit** permission can modify the workflow or its sharing settings

## Connection Sharing

Integration Connections can be shared using the `Connect` menu item on the left side of the Pinkfish dashboard. Once there click the `Share` icon from the Action column.

**Sharing Workflows without sharing associated connections:**

- If you share a workflow without sharing it's connections, the users or organization to whom you share the workflow will not have access to the connections used in the workflow.
- If you later decide to share the connections, you will need to do so separately for each user or organization.

**Sharing Workflows and sharing associated connections:**

- If you share a workflow and additionally share it's connections, the users or organization to whom you share the workflow will have access to the connections used in the workflow.
- If you later decide to unshare the connections, you will need to do so separately for each user or organization. Keep in mind though that doing this may cause the workflow to stop working as expected.

**Important notes about connection sharing specific to workflow sharing:**

- Connections are shared with the same permission level options as workflows and can be shared with users, or entire organizations.
- If a user with whom a workflow is shared decides to use their personal (non-shared) iteration of a connection, this change will propagate to all users who have shared access to the workflow.
