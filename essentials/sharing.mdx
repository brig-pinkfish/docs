**Sharing is different from Duplicating**
Sharing an automation gives another person (or everyone in your organization) access to your automation. When shared, a change made by one person will affect all users who have access to the automation. Duplication however, creates a copy of the automation in either your current organization or another organization to which you have access.

## Sharing Permissions

Every entity within Pinkfish can be shared. Currently Connections and Automations can be shared easily within an organization. In the future, we will enable data store, file store and vault to be shared. Here is how the sharing permissions work.

| **Resource**                   | **Permission** | **_What the User Can Do_**                                        | **_What the User Cannot Do_**            |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**                 | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share automation; manage triggers and API keys | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | View automation                                                   | Cannot edit, delete, run, or share       |
| **Connection**                 | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Run, Share connection                               | —                                        |
|                                | **Run**        | Use connection in automations                                     | Cannot edit, delete, or share connection |
| **Data Store** _(Coming Soon)_ | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Share data store collection                         | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from data store in automations                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |
| **File Store** _(Coming Soon)_ | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Share file store collection                         | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from file store in automations                               | Cannot write, edit, delete, or share     |
| **Vault** _(Coming Soon)_      | **Edit**       | Edit, Delete, Share vault collection                              | —                                        |
|                                | **View**       | Read from vault in automations                                    | Cannot edit, delete, or share            |

## Sharing your automations

Simply navigate to the `Library` menu item on the left side of your Pinkfish dashboard. Once there click the `Share` icon from the Action column. Alternatively you can open the automation you wish to share and click the options menu (⋮) in the upper right corner of that automation and select `Share` from the dropdown menu.

Next a confirmation modal will appear allowing you to choose who you are intending to share this automation with and their permission level. Either for a single, or group of individuals, or to your entire organization.

#### Sharing Options:

- Share with users individually in the **Add People** section. It will autocomplete based on email addresses for the organization.
- Share with an entire organization by selecting **General Access**
- Set permission levels for each user or organization
  - **View**: Users can view the automation, but cannot run or modify it
  - **Edit**: Users can view, run, edit, and manage sharing permissions for the automation
- Click `Share` to apply the settings, and the specified userswill immediately gain access to the automation at the specified permission level.

### Managing Shared Access

To modify or revoke sharing permissions, first navigate to the automation's sharing settings. From there, you can adjust permission levels for individual users or the entire organization as needed. If you want to remove access completely simply click the dropdown menu arrow next to a user's permission, or the General Access dropdown arrow next to the organization. Finally, apply your changes to update the permissions using the `Share` button.

#### Individual vs. Organization permissions

- Individual user permissions take precedence over organization-wide permissions
- If a user has individual **Edit** access, they retain this access even if organization-wide access is set to **View**
- Organization-wide permissions apply to all current and future members of your organization

**Important notes about automation sharing specific to permission levels:**

- Automation can not be shared with users who exist outside of your organization.
- If an individual user with **Edit** access deletes an automation, the automation will be removed from everyone's library who has access to it.
- Since shared automations are meant to be a collaboration tool, if multiple users who have access attempt to make changes to the automation at the same time, a race condition will occur. In which the last user to save will overwrite the changes made by the others.

#### Access Control

Access to shared automations follows these rules:

- Users must be explicitly granted access or be members of an organization with access
- Members of different organizations cannot access the automation unless specifically granted access
- The access level (**View** or **Edit**) determines what actions users can take with the shared automation
- Only users with **Edit** permission can modify the automation or its sharing settings

## Connection Sharing

Integration Connections can be shared using the `Connect` menu item on the left side of the Pinkfish dashboard. Once there click the `Share` icon from the Action column.

**Sharing Automations without sharing associated connections:**

- If you share an automation without sharing it's connections, the users or organization to whom you share the automation will not have access to the connections used in the automation.
- If you later decide to share the connections, you will need to do so separately for each user or organization.

**Sharing Automations and sharing associated connections:**

- If you share an automation and additionally share it's connections, the users or organization to whom you share the automation will have access to the connections used in the automation.
- If you later decide to unshare the connections, you will need to do so separately for each user or organization. Keep in mind though that doing this may cause the automation to stop working as expected.

**Important notes about connection sharing specific to automation sharing:**

- Connections are shared with the same permission level options as automations and can be shared with users, or entire organizations.
- If a user with whom an automation is shared decides to use their personal (non-shared) iteration of a connection, this change will propagate to all users who have shared access to the automation.
