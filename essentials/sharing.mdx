**Sharing is different from Duplicating**
Sharing an automation gives another person (or everyone in your organization) access to your automation. When shared, a change made by one person will affect all users who have access to the automation. Duplication creates a copy of the automation in either your current organization or another organization to which you have access. 


**What are the steps?**
Simply navigate to the Automations Library in your Pinkfish dashboard, and select the automation you wish to share. Click the options menu (â‹®) in the upper right corner of that automation and select "Share". A confirmation modal will appear allowing you to choose who you are intending to share this automation with. Either a single, or group of individuals, or to your entire organization. When you have made your selections, click **Share**.

## Sharing Options:
- Add users in the **Add People** section. It will autocomplete based on the email addresses in the organization.
- Share with an entire organization by selecting **General Access**
- Set permission levels for each user or organization

## Permission Levels

When sharing an automation, you can assign different levels of access:

- **VIEW**: Users can view and run the automation but cannot modify it
- **EDIT**: Users can view, run, edit, and manage sharing permissions for the automation
