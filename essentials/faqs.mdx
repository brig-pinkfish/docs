## General Questions

### What is a Workflow?
A Workflow is a sequence of automated steps that help you get work done. Think of it as a recipe that tells Pinkfish exactly what to do, step by step, to achieve your desired outcome.

### How do I get started with Workflows?
Check out our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) to create your first workflow in minutes. You can also explore our [library](/essentials/library) of pre-built workflows for common use cases.

### What's the difference between a Step and a Workflow?
A **Workflow** is the entire process from start to finish. A **Step** is an individual action within that workflow. For example, a workflow might be "Process customer feedback" while the steps could be "Get emails from Gmail", "Analyze sentiment", and "Send summary report".

## Building Workflows

### How many steps can I have in a workflow?
There's no hard limit on the number of steps, but we recommend keeping workflows focused and manageable. Most effective workflows have 3-10 steps.

### Can I reuse steps from other workflows?
Yes! You can [duplicate workflows](/essentials/duplication) and modify them, or copy specific steps between workflows. This is a great way to build on your existing work.

### How do I pass data between steps?
Use **artifacts** (step outputs) to pass data between steps. When you run a step, its results become available as artifacts that you can reference in subsequent steps using the "Insert path into chat" tool.

### Should I put everything in one step or break it up?
Always break your workflow into multiple steps! This makes it easier to test, debug, and maintain. Follow the golden rule: **First get data, then process data** - use separate steps for data collection and data processing.

## Running Workflows

### How long can workflows run?
Workflows can run for a total of 10 minutes. Individual API calls within your workflow may time out after 2 minutes, as many API providers have their own timeout limits. If you need longer processing times, consider breaking your workflow into smaller, more focused steps.

## Triggers & Automation

### How do I make my workflow run automatically?
Use [Triggers](/essentials/triggers) to automatically start your workflows. You can set up triggers for emails, webhooks, schedules, file uploads, and more.

### Can I schedule workflows to run at specific times?
Yes! You can set up time-based triggers to run workflows on a schedule - daily, weekly, monthly, or at specific times.

### What happens if a step fails?
Workflows will stop at the failed step and show you the error. You can then fix the issue and re-run from that step, or restart the entire workflow.

## Data & Privacy

### Is my data secure?
Yes! Your data is encrypted and stored securely in Amazon S3. Pinkfish follows data minimization practices - our AI agents only see the structure of your data (field names and types), not the actual content, unless you explicitly share it.

### Can I use my own API keys?
Yes! Store your API keys and secrets securely in the [Vault](/essentials/vault) and reference them in your workflows. This keeps your credentials safe and allows you to use your own service quotas.

### What file types can I work with?
Pinkfish supports a wide variety of file types including PDFs, Excel files, images, CSVs, and more. Check out our [file handling](/essentials/files) guide for details.

## Sharing & Collaboration

### Can I share workflows with my team?
Yes! You can [share workflows](/essentials/sharing) with specific team members or make them available to your entire organization. You can also [publish workflows](/essentials/publishing) to make them publicly available.

### How do I manage access to workflows?
Use your [organization settings](/essentials/organization) to control who can view, edit, and run workflows. You can set permissions at the workflow level or for your entire organization.

## Credits & Pricing

### How do credits work?
Credits are consumed when you run workflow steps. Different operations (like AI processing, API calls, or file operations) use different amounts of credits. See our [credits guide](/essentials/credits) for details.

### What are the usage limits?
Check our [limits page](/essentials/limits) for current usage limits and quotas. These help ensure fair usage and system performance for all users.

### Can I see how many credits a workflow will use?
While exact credit usage depends on your data and operations, you can estimate based on the types of steps in your workflow. Monitor your usage in the dashboard and optimize workflows to be more efficient.

## Advanced Features

### Can I use custom code in workflows?
Yes! You can use paste code directly into the code editor. Or you can paste code (in any language) into the prompt and it'll be converted into JavaScript (our runtime is JavaScript)

### How do I debug workflow issues?
Use the [Monitor](/essentials/monitor) feature to track workflow runs, view logs, and identify issues. You can also test individual steps before running the full workflow.

### Can I integrate with external systems?
Absolutely! Pinkfish supports hundreds of [API integrations](/slash-commands) including popular services like Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and many more.
