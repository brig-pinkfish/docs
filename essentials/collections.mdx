# Collections

Collections help you organize and manage your assets across Data, Files, and Vault sections. These powerful organizational tools are accessible from the main header menu and provide utility when working with other platform features.

<Info>
  Collections provide a structured way to categorize your assets, making them easier to find, manage, and use in your automations.

## What are Collections?

Collections are organizational containers that help you group related items within Pinkfish's Data, Files, and Vault features. They provide a structured way to categorize your assets, making them easier to find, manage, and use in your automations.

## Collection Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Collections">
    Data Collections help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

    When working with Data Collections, you can:

    - Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
    - View items in either document or table format based on their structure
    - Easily reference collections in automation workflows
    - Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
    - Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="File Collections">
    File Collections provide an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's File Storage system. They help you manage various types of files used in your automations.

    File Collections enable you to:

    - Group related files such as templates, configurations, or documentation
    - Maintain version history across collection items
    - Apply consistent metadata and access controls to files
    - Reference file collections in your automations
    - Share sets of files with appropriate access permissions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vault Collections">
    Vault Collections help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your automations.

    With Vault Collections, you can:

    - Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
    - Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
    - Reference entire collections of secrets in automation workflows
    - Rotate credentials across collections when needed
    - Maintain clear separation between different security contexts
  </Tab>

## Collection Limits

Understanding the limits that apply to collections helps you plan your organization strategy effectively:

### Items per Collection

Each collection type has a maximum capacity:

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Data Collections" icon="database">
    10,000 items per collection
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Collections" icon="file">
    1,000 files per collection
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vault Collections" icon="lock">
    100 secrets per collection
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Collections per Plan

The number of collections available depends on your subscription plan:

| Collection Type | Starter | Pro | Team | Enterprise |
| --------------- | ------- | --- | ---- | ---------- |
| Data            | 1       | 1   | 10   | 100        |
| Files           | 1       | 1   | 10   | 100        |
| Vault           | 1       | 1   | 10   | 100        |

<Info>
  For Team and Enterprise plans, these limits apply at the organization level, allowing all members to collaborate within the same collections.
</Info>

For more detailed information about platform limits, see our [Limits](/essentials/limits) documentation.

## Using Collections with Automations

Collections integrate seamlessly with Pinkfish automations, allowing you to reference grouped items without hardcoding individual references.

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Data Processing" icon="database">
    Reference a Data Collection to process multiple datastore items in sequence
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Management" icon="gears">
    Use a File Collection to work with a set of related configuration files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Access" icon="lock">
    Access a Vault Collection to retrieve multiple credentials needed for complex workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This approach provides better maintainability and flexibility in your automations, as you can modify collection contents without changing your automation code.

### Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```
// Reference an entire Data Collection
/datastore get items from collection: "customer-records"
```


```
// Process all files in a collection
/filestorage get files from collection: "email-templates"
```


```
// Access credentials from a collection
/get-secrets from collection: "api-credentials"
```

</CodeGroup>
