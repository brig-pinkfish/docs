Collections help you organize and manage your assets across three main areas:
- [Data](/slash-commands/datastore) - For organizing your data items
- [Files](/slash-commands/filestorage) - For managing your files
- [Vault](/essentials/vault) - For securing your credentials

These powerful organizational tools are accessible from the main header menu and provide utility when working with other platform features.

<Info>
  Collections provide a structured way to categorize your assets, making them easier to find, manage, and use in your automations.
  For information about collection limits and availability based on your subscription plan, please refer to our [Limits](/essentials/limits) and [Pricing](/essentials/pricing) documentation.

## What are Collections?

Collections are organizational containers that help you group related items within Pinkfish's Data, Files, and Vault features.

## Collection Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Collections">
    [Data Collections](/slash-commands/datastore) help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

    When working with Data Collections, you can:

    - Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
    - View items in either document or table format based on their structure
    - Easily reference collections in automation workflows
    - Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
    - Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="File Collections">
    [File Collections](/slash-commands/filestorage) provide an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's File Storage system. They help you manage various types of files used in your automations.

    File Collections enable you to:

    - Group related files such as templates, configurations, or documentation
    - Maintain version history across collection items
    - Apply consistent metadata and access controls to files
    - Reference file collections in your automations
    - Share sets of files with appropriate access permissions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vault Collections">
    [Vault Collections](/essentials/vault) help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your automations.

    With Vault Collections, you can:

    - Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
    - Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
    - Reference entire collections of secrets in automation workflows
    - Rotate credentials across collections when needed
    - Maintain clear separation between different security contexts
  </Tab>

## Creating and Managing Collections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Collections">
    Navigate to the main header menu and select the appropriate section (Data, Files, or Vault)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Collection">
    Click the "\+" or "New Collection" button to create a new collection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and Configure">
    Provide a name and configure any collection-specific settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Items">
    Add existing items to your collection or create new ones directly within it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Access">
    Configure permissions to control who can view or edit the collection
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sharing Collections

<Warning>
  Be cautious when sharing collections containing sensitive information. Always apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access permissions.
</Warning>

Collections can be shared with specific team members or your entire organization. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Automations

Collections integrate seamlessly with Pinkfish automations, allowing you to reference grouped items without hardcoding individual references.

  <Card title="Data Processing" icon="database">
    Reference a Data Collection to process multiple datastore items in sequence
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Management" icon="gears">
    Use a File Collection to work with a set of related configuration files
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Access" icon="lock">
    Access a Vault Collection to retrieve multiple credentials needed for complex workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This approach provides better maintainability and flexibility in your automations, as you can modify collection contents without changing your automation code.
