Collections are organizational containers that help you group related items within Pinkfish's Datastore, Filestore, and Vault features.

## Collection Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Collections">
    [Data Collections](/slash-commands/datastore) help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

    When working with Data Collections, you can:

    - Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
    - View items in either document or table format based on their structure
    - Easily reference collections in workflow workflows
    - Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
    - Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="File Collections">
    [File Collections](/slash-commands/filestorage) provide an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's File Storage system. They help you manage various types of files used in your workflows.

    File Collections enable you to:

    - Group related files such as templates, configurations, or documentation
    - Maintain version history across collection items
    - Apply consistent metadata and access controls to files
    - Reference file collections in your workflows
    - Share sets of files with appropriate access permissions

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vault Collections">
    [Vault Collections](/essentials/vault) help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your workflows.

    With Vault Collections, you can:

    - Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
    - Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
    - Reference entire collections of secrets in workflow workflows
    - Rotate credentials across collections when needed
    - Maintain clear separation between different security contexts

## Sharing Collections

<Warning>
  Be cautious when sharing collections containing sensitive information. Always
  apply the principle of least privilege when configuring access permissions.
</Warning>

Collections can be shared with specific team members or your entire organization. Different permission levels (View/Edit) control what actions others can perform with your shared collections.

For detailed information about sharing permissions and procedures, see our [Sharing](/essentials/sharing) documentation.

## Using Collections with Workflows

To reference a collection from your workflow, select it from the Slash command. Selecting it will insert a reference to that collection and items within it into your code.
