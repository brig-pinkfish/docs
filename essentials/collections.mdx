# Collections
Collections help you organize and manage your assets across Data, Files, and Vault sections. These powerful organizational tools are accessible from the main header menu and provide utility when working with other platform features.

## What are Collections?
Collections are organizational containers that help you group related items within Pinkfish's Data, Files, and Vault features. They provide a structured way to categorize your assets, making them easier to find, manage, and use in your automations.

Key benefits of using collections include:
- **Improved Organization**: Group related items together logically
- **Easier Discovery**: Quickly find the assets you need
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share entire collections with team members
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Reference collections in automations
- **Better Governance**: Apply consistent permissions to grouped items

## Data Collections
Data Collections help you organize items stored in the Datastore. They provide a way to group related data items that share similar purposes or attributes.

When working with Data Collections, you can:
- Group related datastore items with similar key patterns
- View items in either document or table format based on their structure
- Easily reference collections in automation workflows
- Share collections with specific team members or the entire organization
- Apply bulk operations to multiple data items simultaneously

## File Collections
File Collections provide an organizational structure for files stored in Pinkfish's File Storage system. They help you manage various types of files used in your automations.

File Collections enable you to:
- Group related files such as templates, configurations, or documentation
- Maintain version history across collection items
- Apply consistent metadata and access controls to files
- Reference file collections in your automations
- Share sets of files with appropriate access permissions

## Vault Collections
Vault Collections help you organize your secure credentials and sensitive information stored in Pinkfish's Vault. They provide a structured way to manage secrets used across your automations.

With Vault Collections, you can:
- Group related credentials by service, environment, or purpose
- Manage access to sensitive information with fine-grained controls
- Reference entire collections of secrets in automation workflows
- Rotate credentials across collections when needed
- Maintain clear separation between different security contexts

## Collection Limits
Understanding the limits that apply to collections helps you plan your organization strategy effectively:

### Items per Collection
Each collection type has a maximum capacity:
- **Data Collections**: Up to 10,000 items per collection
- **File Collections**: Up to 1,000 files per collection
- **Vault Collections**: Up to 100 secrets per collection

### Collections per Plan
The number of collections available depends on your subscription plan:

| Collection Type | Starter | Pro | Team | Enterprise |
|-----------------|---------|-----|------|------------|
| Data | 1 | 1 | 10 | 100 |
| Files | 1 | 1 | 10 | 100 |
| Vault | 1 | 1 | 10 | 100 |

<Info>
For Team and Enterprise plans, these limits apply at the organization level, allowing all members to collaborate within the same collections.

## Using Collections with Automations
Collections integrate seamlessly with Pinkfish automations, allowing you to reference grouped items without hardcoding individual references.

For example:
- Reference a Data Collection to process multiple datastore items in sequence
- Use a File Collection to work with a set of related configuration files
- Access a Vault Collection to retrieve multiple credentials needed for complex workflows

This approach provides better maintainability and flexibility in your automations, as you can modify collection contents without changing your automation code.
