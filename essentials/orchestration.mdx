## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration in Pinkfish allows you to coordinate and manage complex automation workflows at scale. Instead of running individual automations in isolation, orchestration helps you:

- **Monitor** workflow execution across queues
- **Queue** automations for efficient processing and resource management
- **Batch** large jobs into manageable pieces for parallel execution

## Orchestration Components

### [Monitor](/essentials/monitor)

Get comprehensive visibility into your automation workflows with real-time monitoring, execution tracking, and performance insights across all your automations.

### [Queue Service](/essentials/queue)

Organize and control automation execution with custom queues that manage concurrency, retries, and priority levels for optimal resource utilization.

### [Batch Service](/essentials/batching)

Break down large-scale jobs into smaller, manageable pieces that can be processed in parallel through queues, with completion tracking and automated triggers.

## How They Work Together

1. **Create batches** of work items for large-scale processing
2. **Submit items to queues** for organized, controlled execution
3. **Monitor progress** in real-time across all workflows
4. **Scale automatically** based on queue configuration and system capacity

This orchestration layer ensures your automations run efficiently, reliably, and at scale while providing full visibility into their execution.
