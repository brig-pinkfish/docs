## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration in Pinkfish allows you to coordinate and manage complex automation workflows at scale. Instead of running individual automations in isolation, orchestration helps you:

- **Monitor** workflow execution across queues
- **Queue** automations for efficient processing and resource management
- **Batch** large jobs into manageable pieces for parallel execution
- **Trigger** automations based on schedules, events, or API calls

## Orchestration Components

<Card title="Monitor" icon="chart-line" href="/essentials/monitor">
  Get comprehensive visibility into your automation workflows with real-time
  monitoring, execution tracking, and performance insights across all your
  automations.
</Card>

<Card title="Queue Service" icon="list-check" href="/essentials/queue">
  Organize and control automation execution with custom queues that manage
  concurrency, retries, and priority levels for optimal resource utilization.
</Card>

<Card title="Batch Service" icon="layer-group" href="/essentials/batching">
  Break down large-scale jobs into smaller, manageable pieces that can be
  processed in parallel through queues, with completion tracking and automated
  triggers.
</Card>

<Card title="Triggers" icon="play" href="/essentials/triggers">
  Automate the start of your workflows with scheduled triggers, API endpoints,
  and webhooks that integrate your automations into business processes and
  external systems.
</Card>

## How They Work Together

1. **Set up triggers** to automatically start workflows based on schedules, events, or API calls
2. **Create batches** of work items for large-scale processing
3. **Submit items to queues** for organized, controlled execution
4. **Monitor progress** in real-time across all workflows
5. **Scale automatically** based on queue configuration and system capacity

This orchestration layer ensures your automations run efficiently, reliably, and at scale while providing full visibility into their execution.
