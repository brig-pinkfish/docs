## API Connections

API Connections are your bread and butter. You can use them to get data from any service that exposes an API. Most modern services do and we've got a growing list of Connections that work out of the box. On the Connections page, click the plus sign, authenticate, and then you're off to the races.

If we don't already have an API connection that you want, you now have two options:
1. **Create your own custom integration** - Use our integration builder to create connections for any service with an API
2. **Request a pre-built integration** - Send a note to support@pinkfish.ai and we'll create one for you

API Connections allow you to retrieve data from and write data to external services, like Salesforce, Google Sheets, Slack, and more. So if you want to write a workflow that gets a list of new customers from Salesforce and then sends your sales team an update in Slack showing customers who signed up today with ARR over $40k, this is where you start.

## Create Custom Integrations

You can now build your own custom API integrations directly in Pinkfish. Our integration builder supports:

- **OAuth 2.0** - User-centric authentication flow where users grant permission to access their data
- **API Key** - Simple authentication using API keys for server-to-server communication

To create a custom integration, go to the Integrations page and click "Create Custom Integration". You'll be guided through setting up the basic info, authentication method, and API configuration.
