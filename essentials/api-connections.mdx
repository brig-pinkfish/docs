## API Connections

API Connections are your bread and butter. You can use them to get data from any service that exposes an API. Most modern services do and we've got a growing list of Connections that work out of the box. On the Connections page, click the plus sign, authenticate, and then you're off to the races.

If we don't already have an API connection that you want, send a note to support@pinkfish.ai and we'll get one going for you. Coming soon, you'll be able to create your own API Connections.

API Connections allow you to retrieve data from and write data to external services, like Salesforce, Google Sheets, Slack, and more. So if you want to write a workflow that gets a list of new customers from Salesforce and then sends your sales team an update in Slack showing customers who signed up today with ARR over $40k, this is where you start.
