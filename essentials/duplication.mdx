# Automation Duplication
Quickly duplicate your automations to create similar workflows with minimal effort.

## What is Duplication?
Automation duplication allows you to create copies of your existing automations quickly and efficiently. This feature is particularly useful when you need to create similar automations with minimal modifications, saving time and ensuring consistency across your workflow processes.

**Duplication is different from sharing**
Duplication creates a copy of the automation in either your current organization or another organization to which you have access. Sharing an automation gives another person (or everyone in your organization) access to your automation. When shared, a change made by one person will affect all users who have access to the automation.


## Duplicating to Current Organization
Here are the steps to duplicate an automation:

To duplicate an automation, first navigate to the Automations Library page in your Pinkfish dashboard. Once there, find and select the automation you wish to duplicate. Then, locate the options menu (â‹®) in the upper right corner of that automation and click it. From the dropdown menu that appears, select "Duplicate". A configuration modal will now appear allowing you to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select the organization that you would like to duplicate this automation to; here we will keep the default selection "Selected Org" (see below for Other Orgs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Give this duplicate copy a name **(by default we append "Copy of" to the original automation name)**
&nbsp;&nbsp;- See the automation attributes that will be duplicated
* Step 6: Select **"Duplicate"**

**What Gets Duplicated?**
* The duplicated automation will have a new unique identifier (ID), but will retain the same organization and owner as the original.
* The following automation elements are copied when creating a duplication:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Automation name (with "-Copy" appended)
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Automation steps
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Connections
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chat
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Test Inputs

**What Is Not Duplicated?**
* Triggers
* Files


## Duplicating to Other Organizations
Steps 1 through 4 are exactly the same as above, however there are a couple key differences:
* When the configuration modal will appears you will choose "Other Orgs". Once this is selected you will be able to duplicate this automation to other organizations that you have added to Pinkfish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Give this copy a name **(by default we add "Copy " appended to the original name)**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- See the automation attributes that will be duplicated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- NOTE: When duplicating to Other Orgs the organizational ownership of this copy will change to be owned by the selected organization.

* Step 6: Select **"Duplicate"**

**What Gets Duplicated?**
* The duplicated automation will have a new unique identifier (ID), a new organization (based on selection), but will retain the same owner as the original.
* The following automation elements are copied when creating a duplication:
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Automation name (with "-Copy" appended)
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Automation steps
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Test Inputs

**What Is Not Duplicated?**
* Connections
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Note that the person in the other organization will not have access to the connections. They will see a modal that asks them to reconfigure the connections to use their own. 
* Triggers
* Files
