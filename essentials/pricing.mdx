#### Credit Impact When Upgrading

<Note>
  When you upgrade your plan, your unused credits immediately increase to the new plan's allocation.
</Note>

For example, if you upgrade from a plan with 5,000 credits to one with 15,000 credits:
- Your credit limit instantly increases to 15,000
- Your current usage remains unchanged
- Any overage is recalculated based on your new higher limit

<Warning>
  If you were in overage: You'll immediately stop incurring overage charges. The higher credit limit applies right away, so if your usage was previously exceeding your old plan's limits, it may now fall within your new plan's allocation.
</Warning>

### Downgrading Your Plan

When moving to a lower-tier plan:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Feature Access" icon="toggle-on">
    Immediate adjustment to new plan's feature set
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Impact" icon="money-bill">
    - Continues on current billing cycle
    - New lower rate applies on next billing date
    - No refunds for unused time on previous plan
    - Retain access until next billing date
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Credit Impact When Downgrading

<Note>
  Your current credit allocation remains active until the end of your billing period.
</Note>

For example, if you downgrade from a plan with 15,000 credits to one with 5,000 credits:
- You keep your 15,000 credit allocation until your current billing period ends
- At renewal, your credit allocation will adjust to 5,000
- Any usage over 5,000 credits in future billing periods will count as overage

## Billing Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```text Credit Overage Example
  If you've used 8,000 credits on a 5,000 credit plan (3,000 in overage) and upgrade to a 15,000 credit plan:
  - Your usage remains at 8,000 credits
  - Your new limit is 15,000 credits
  - You are no longer in overage (8,000 < 15,000)
  - Any overage charges not yet billed will be removed
  
  This ensures you get the full benefit of your plan upgrade immediately.
  ```
