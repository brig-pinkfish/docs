# Pricing Plans
Pinkfish offers flexible pricing plans to accommodate different needs, from individual users to enterprise organizations. Choose between monthly and annual billing options, with annual plans offering significant savings.

## Plan Overview
We offer three main pricing tiers:
- **Starter Plan**: Free tier with limited features and credits

## What are credits?
Credits are the primary currency within Pinkfish. Each plan includes a set number of credits:

### Credit System Details
Understanding how credits work with plan changes:
