    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Credit Impact When Upgrading

<Note>
  When you upgrade your plan, your unused credits immediately increase to the new plan's allocation.
</Note>

For example, if you upgrade from a plan with 5,000 credits to one with 25,000 credits:

- Your credit limit instantly increases to 25,000
- Your current usage will reset to 0 credits
- Any additional usage is recalculated based on your new higher limit

<Warning>
  If you were previously using additional credits beyond your plan's limit: You'll immediately stop incurring charges for additional usage. The higher credit limit applies right away, so if your usage was previously exceeding your old plan's limits, it may now fall within your new plan's allocation.
</Warning>

### Downgrading Your Plan

When moving to a lower-tier plan:

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Feature Access" icon="toggle-on">
    Immediate adjustment to new plan's feature set
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Impact" icon="money-bill">
    - Continues on current billing cycle
    - New lower rate applies on next billing date
    - No refunds for unused time on previous plan
    - Retain access until next billing date
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Credit Impact When Downgrading

<Note>
  Your current credit allocation remains active until the end of your billing period.
</Note>

For example, if you downgrade from a plan with 25,000 credits to one with 5,000 credits:

- You keep your 25,000 credit allocation until your current billing period ends
- At renewal, your credit allocation will adjust to 5,000
- Any usage over 5,000 credits in future billing periods will be billed as additional usage

## Billing Example

<CodeGroup>

```text Credit Additional Usage Example
If you've used 8,000 credits on a 5,000 credit plan (3,000 credits of additional 
usage) and upgrade to a 25,000 credit plan:
- Your usage will reset to 0 credits
- Your new limit is 25,000 credits
- You are no longer using additional credits beyond your limit (8,000 < 25,000)
- Any charges for additional usage not yet billed will be removed

This ensures you get the full benefit of your plan upgrade immediately.
```
