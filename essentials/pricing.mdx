## What are credits?

Each plan includes credits that can be spent on value-added services like LLM calls, API calls, browser operator sessions, and more. Credits extend your platform's capabilities beyond the included resources.

### Credit Allocation Policy

- **Starter Plan**: Includes 1,000 free credits for the 30-day trial period
- **Monthly Plans**: Credits are allocated at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle
- **Annual Plans**: Credits for the entire year are allocated upfront at the start of your subscription
- **Usage Tracking**: All credit usage is monitored against your total allocation
- **User Sharing**: Pro plan credits cannot be shared among users, while Team plan credits are shared across organization members
- **Unused Credits**: Unused included-tier credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle

For detailed information on which services consume credits and their rates, please refer to our [Credits](/essentials/credits#service-specific-credit-consumption) documentation.

## Plan Changes

You can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime through your account dashboard, with changes taking effect immediately.

**When Upgrading:**
- Immediate access to all new features
- For upgrades from Starter, you're billed immediately for your new plan 
- For upgrades between paid plans, you only pay the difference for the remainder of the billing cycle
- Your credit limit instantly increases to the new plan's allocation
- Current usage resets to 0 credits
- If you had unbilled usage on your previous plan, it will be invoiced immediately 

**When Downgrading:**
- You will stay on your current plan until period expiry
- The new lower rate applies on your next billing date
- You keep your current credit allocation until your billing period ends
- At renewal, your allocation adjusts to the new plan's limits

## Additional Credit Pricing

When you exceed your included credits, additional usage is billed at graduated rates (less expensive as you use more):
