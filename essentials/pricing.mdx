# Pricing Plans
Pinkfish offers flexible pricing plans to accommodate different needs, from individual users to enterprise organizations. Choose between monthly and annual billing options, with annual plans offering significant savings.

## Plan Overview
We offer three main pricing tiers:
- **Starter Plan**: Free tier with limited features and credits
- **Pro Plans**: Professional tiers with expanded features for individual users
- **Team Plans**: Multi-user tiers with advanced collaboration and all Pro Plan features

## What are credits?
Credits are the primary currency within Pinkfish. Each subscription plan consists of two components:

- A base recurring price (monthly or annual) with a fixed credit allocation
- A metered usage price for any credits used beyond your allocation

### Credit System Details
Understanding how credits work with plan changes:

#### Credit Allocation
- Credits are allocated at the start of each billing cycle
- Annual plans receive the full year's credits upfront
- Monthly plans receive monthly credit allocations
- Unused credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle
- Usage beyond your plan's credit allocation incurs overage charges

#### Usage Tracking
- Credit usage is automatically tracked
- View current usage in your dashboard
- Receive notifications when approaching or exceeding credit limits
- Each plan includes specific credit amounts as detailed above

## What happens when I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?

### Upgrading Your Plan

When you upgrade to a higher tier plan:
- Your billing cycle will reset, starting a fresh period with your new plan
- You'll be billed immediately for the new plan
- Your usage counter will reset to 0 credits
- Your new higher credit limit takes effect immediately
- **Immediate Access**: Get instant access to all features in your new plan

For example, if you upgrade from a plan with 5,000 credits to one with 15,000 credits:
- You start fresh with a full 15,000 credit allocation
- Your billing period resets to begin on the upgrade date
- Any usage from your previous plan is finalized and billed

### Downgrading Your Plan

When you downgrade to a lower tier plan:
- Your current plan remains active until the end of your billing period
- At renewal, your plan will change to the lower tier
- No immediate billing changes occur
- **Feature Access**: You'll retain access to your current plan's features until the end of the billing period

For example, if you downgrade from a plan with 15,000 credits to one with 5,000 credits:
- You keep your 15,000 credit allocation until your current billing period ends
- At renewal, your credit allocation will adjust to 5,000
- Future usage over 5,000 credits will incur overage charges

### Changing Billing Frequency

#### Monthly to Annual
When switching from monthly to annual billing:
- Your monthly subscription will be canceled immediately
- A final invoice will be generated for any usage on your monthly plan
- A new annual subscription will start immediately
- You'll be billed for the full annual amount

#### Annual to Monthly
When switching from annual to monthly billing:
- Your annual subscription will be set to cancel at the end of the current period
- A new monthly subscription will be automatically created to start when your annual plan ends
- You'll continue to have access to your annual plan until it expires
- Your monthly billing will begin only after your annual subscription ends

## Seats and Team Plans

Some plans include a specific number of user seats:
- Each plan specifies the number of included seats
- Some higher-tier plans offer unlimited seats
- Your dashboard will show your current seat usage and limits

## Billing Examples

**Example 1: Upgrading Plans**  
If you've used 3,000 credits on a 5,000 credit plan and upgrade to a 15,000 credit plan:
- Your billing period will reset, starting from your upgrade date
- Your usage counter will reset to 0 credits
- You'll have a fresh allocation of 15,000 credits on your new plan
- A final bill will be generated for usage on your previous plan

**Example 2: Downgrading Plans**  
If you're on a 15,000 credit plan and downgrade to a 5,000 credit plan:
- You'll continue to have 15,000 credits until your current billing period ends
- When your next billing period begins, you'll have 5,000 credits
- No refunds are provided for downgrades
