## What is Publishing in Workflows?

Publishing is the process of creating a stable, versioned release of your Workflow. It's a crucial step that turns your work-in-progress Workflow into a fixed version that can be reliably used and referenced.

## Key Aspects of Publishing

### Version Control

- Each time you publish, a new version of your Workflow is created.
- Versions are numbered sequentially (e.g., v1, v2, v3).
- The platform maintains a history of all published versions.

### Unpublished changes (Drafts)

After publishing, if you make changes to your Workflow, you'll see "unpublished changes" next to the publish button. This is your indicator that you've made changes since the last publish. This means that your current working version is a draft and you can edit and run it without fear of impacting a version that may be in production. When you're comfortable with the changes, you can publish again.

If you're working on an API and are wondering why it's not working as you expect, it's often becaause you forgot to publish.

### Triggers and Publishing

- Triggers (ways to start your Workflow) can only be set up for published versions.
- This ensures that triggers always reference a stable, unchanging version of your Workflow.

## Why Publishing is Important

Publishing is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Stability**: It creates a fixed point in your Workflow's development that won't change, ensuring consistent behavior.

2. **Versioning**: It allows you to maintain multiple versions of your Workflow, facilitating testing and gradual rollouts.

3. **Trigger Management**: It enables you to set up triggers that reference specific, stable versions of your Workflow.

4. **Collaboration**: Published versions provide clear reference points for team members or other systems interacting with your Workflow.

5. **Rollback Capability** (coming soon): If issues arise, you can easily revert to a previous published version.

Understanding the publishing process is key to effectively managing and deploying your Workflows. It allows you to create stable, versioned workflows that can be reliably used in production environments while still allowing for ongoing development and improvement.
