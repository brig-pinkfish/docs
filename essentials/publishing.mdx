## What are Releases in Workflows?

A release is the process of publishing a stable, versioned snapshot of your Workflow. It's a crucial step that turns your work-in-progress Workflow into a fixed version that can be reliably used and referenced in production.

## Key Aspects of Releases

### Version Control

- Each time you publish a release, a new version of your Workflow is created.
- Versions are numbered sequentially (e.g., v1, v2, v3).
- The platform maintains a history of all published releases.

### Unpublished changes (Drafts)

After publishing a release, if you make changes to your Workflow, you'll see "unpublished changes" next to the publish button. This is your indicator that you've made changes since the last release. This means that your current working version is a draft and you can edit and run it without fear of impacting a version that may be in production. When you're comfortable with the changes, you can publish a new release.

If you're working on an API and are wondering why it's not working as you expect, it's often because you forgot to publish a release.

### Triggers and Releases

- Triggers (ways to start your Workflow) can only be set up for published releases.
- This ensures that triggers always reference a stable, unchanging version of your Workflow.

## Why Publishing Releases is Important

Publishing releases is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Stability**: It creates a fixed point in your Workflow's development that won't change, ensuring consistent behavior.

2. **Versioning**: It allows you to maintain multiple releases of your Workflow, facilitating testing and gradual rollouts.

3. **Trigger Management**: It enables you to set up triggers that reference specific, stable releases of your Workflow.

4. **Collaboration**: Published releases provide clear reference points for team members or other systems interacting with your Workflow.

5. **Rollback Capability** (coming soon): If issues arise, you can easily revert to a previous published release.

## How to Publish a Release

1. **Complete your workflow development** and test thoroughly
2. **Click the "Publish" button** in your workflow editor
3. **Review the changes** since your last release
4. **Confirm the release** to create a new versioned snapshot
5. **Set up triggers** that reference your newly published release

Understanding the release process is key to effectively managing and deploying your Workflows. It allows you to create stable, versioned workflows that can be reliably used in production environments while still allowing for ongoing development and improvement.
