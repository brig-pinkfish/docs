# Queue Service

The Queue service provides powerful workflow orchestration capabilities, allowing you to efficiently manage and execute automation runs at scale.

## Queue Management

### Creating Queues

Create custom queues to organize and manage your automation workflows:

- **Queue Name**: Give your queue a descriptive name
- **Description**: Add context about the queue's purpose
- **Concurrency**: Control how many jobs can run simultaneously
- **Max Retries**: Set the number of retry attempts for failed jobs
- **Priority**: Define queue priority levels (higher numbers = higher priority)

### Queue Dashboard

Monitor your queues with real-time status information:

- **Pending Jobs**: View the number of jobs waiting to be processed
- **Running Jobs**: Track currently executing workflows
- **Queue Actions**: Access batch management and monitoring options

## Integration with Other Services

The Queue service works seamlessly with other Pinkfish services to provide comprehensive workflow orchestration capabilities.

## Worker Automation

Configure how your queue items are processed:

- **Automation Selection**: Choose which automation handles queue items
- **API Endpoints**: Select specific API endpoints for processing
- **Dynamic Processing**: Each queue item can trigger the assigned automation with its specific data

## Monitoring & Tracking

The Queue service integrates with the Monitor tab to provide comprehensive tracking:

- **Workflow Runs**: View detailed execution history
- **Duration Tracking**: Monitor how long jobs take to complete
- **Status Monitoring**: Track success, failure, and retry states
- **Real-time Updates**: Get live updates on queue processing

## Key Features

- **Scalable Processing**: Handle large volumes of automation runs
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize concurrency, retries, and priorities
- **Batch Operations**: Upload and process multiple jobs simultaneously
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with existing automations
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into queue performance

The Queue service is designed to help you scale your automation workflows efficiently while maintaining control over resource usage and execution priorities.

# Batch Service

The Batch service provides a powerful way to break down large jobs into manageable pieces and process them systematically through queues.

## What is the Batch Service?

The Batch service helps you handle large-scale processing tasks by:

- **Creating batches** of related work items with a unique batchId
- **Breaking down big jobs** into individual processable items
- **Distributing work** across queue systems for parallel processing
- **Tracking completion** and triggering actions when batches finish

## How Batch Works

### Batch Creation

When you create a batch:

1. **Define your work items** - Each item represents one unit of work to be processed
2. **Assign a workflow** - Choose which automation will process each item
3. **Select a queue** - Choose which queue will handle the processing
4. **Configure completion actions** - Set what happens when the entire batch finishes

### Batch Processing Flow

```
1. Batch Service creates batch with unique batchId
2. Each batch item is assigned to specified workflow
3. All items are placed into the selected queue
4. Queue processes each item independently
5. Queue tracks completion of all items with same batchId
6. When batch completes, configured completion actions trigger
```

## Batch Features

### Batch Management

- **Unique Identification**: Each batch gets a unique batchId for tracking
- **Flexible Item Structure**: Define custom data for each batch item
- **Workflow Assignment**: Assign any automation to process batch items
- **Queue Selection**: Choose which queue handles the processing

### Completion Actions

Configure what happens when all items in a batch are complete:

- **No action**: Simply mark the batch as complete
- **Execute trigger**: Fire a specific trigger when batch finishes
- **Call webhook URL**: Send HTTP notification to external systems

### Monitoring & Tracking

- **Batch Status**: Track overall batch progress and completion
- **Item-level Tracking**: Monitor individual item processing status
- **Real-time Updates**: Get live updates on batch processing progress
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Queue monitoring dashboards

## Connection to Queue Service

The Batch service integrates tightly with the Queue service:

- **Batch items** are placed into queues for processing
- **Queue workers** process individual batch items
- **Queue tracking** monitors batch completion status
- **Completion triggers** are fired by the queue when batches finish

This separation allows you to use batches for large-scale processing while leveraging queue capabilities for reliable, scalable execution.
