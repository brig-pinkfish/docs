## Queue Management

Create custom queues to organize automation workflows:

- **Queue Name**: Descriptive name for your queue
- **Concurrency**: Control simultaneous job execution
- **Max Retries**: Set retry attempts for failed jobs
- **Priority**: Define queue priority levels

Monitor queues with real-time status showing pending jobs, running jobs, and queue actions.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Processing**: Handle large volumes of automation runs
- **Batch Operations**: Upload and process multiple jobs simultaneously
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into queue performance via Monitor tab

For practical examples of using queues to handle complex workflows, see [Breaking Up Big Jobs](/how-to/breaking-big-jobs).
