# Queue Service

The Queue service provides powerful workflow orchestration capabilities, allowing you to efficiently manage and execute automation runs at scale.

## Queue Management

### Creating Queues

Create custom queues to organize and manage your automation workflows:

- **Queue Name**: Give your queue a descriptive name
- **Description**: Add context about the queue's purpose
- **Concurrency**: Control how many jobs can run simultaneously
- **Max Retries**: Set the number of retry attempts for failed jobs
- **Priority**: Define queue priority levels (higher numbers = higher priority)

### Queue Dashboard

Monitor your queues with real-time status information:

- **Pending Jobs**: View the number of jobs waiting to be processed
- **Running Jobs**: Track currently executing workflows
- **Queue Actions**: Access bulk upload and management options

## Bulk Upload

Efficiently add multiple jobs to your queue:

1. **Data Upload**: Upload job data with ID, Name, and Reason fields
2. **Worker Automation**: Assign which automation will process each queue item
3. **Completion Actions**: Configure what happens when jobs finish:
   - **No action**: Simply complete the job
   - **Execute trigger**: Fire a trigger after completion
   - **Call webhook URL**: Send a webhook notification

## Worker Automation

Configure how your queue items are processed:

- **Automation Selection**: Choose which automation handles queue items
- **API Endpoints**: Select specific API endpoints for processing
- **Dynamic Processing**: Each queue item can trigger the assigned automation with its specific data

## Monitoring & Tracking

The Queue service integrates with the Monitor tab to provide comprehensive tracking:

- **Workflow Runs**: View detailed execution history
- **Duration Tracking**: Monitor how long jobs take to complete
- **Status Monitoring**: Track success, failure, and retry states
- **Real-time Updates**: Get live updates on queue processing

## Key Features

- **Scalable Processing**: Handle large volumes of automation runs
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize concurrency, retries, and priorities
- **Batch Operations**: Upload and process multiple jobs simultaneously
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with existing automations
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into queue performance

The Queue service is designed to help you scale your automation workflows efficiently while maintaining control over resource usage and execution priorities.
