# Platform Limits

Our platform includes certain limits and constraints to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and fair usage across all customers. This guide explains these limits and how they may affect your usage.

## Overview

Pinkfish implements various limits to ensure the platform remains stable, secure, and performant for all users. These limits are designed to prevent resource abuse while still providing flexibility for legitimate use cases. Understanding these limits helps you design more effective automations and manage your resources efficiently.

<Info>
  Different limits apply to different aspects of the platform. Some are tied to your subscription plan, some are technical constraints, and some exist for security and compliance reasons.
