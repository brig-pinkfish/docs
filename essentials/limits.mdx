# Platform Limits

Our platform includes certain limits and constraints to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and fair usage across all customers. This guide explains these limits and how they may affect your usage.

## Overview

Pinkfish implements various limits to ensure the platform remains stable, secure, and performant for all users. These limits are designed to prevent resource abuse while still providing flexibility for legitimate use cases. Understanding these limits helps you design more effective automations and manage your resources efficiently.

<Info>
  Different limits apply to different aspects of the platform. Some are tied to your subscription plan, some are technical constraints, and some exist for security and compliance reasons.

## Concurrency Limits

Pinkfish manages concurrency to ensure platform stability and fair resource allocation:

### Browser Operator Concurrency

The number of concurrent browser automation sessions you can run:

- **Starter Plan**: 1 concurrent session

The number of automations that can run simultaneously:

- **Starter Plan**: 5 concurrent runs
- **Pro Plans**: 5 concurrent runs

- **Enterprise Plans**: 200\+ concurrent runs

### Datastore Concurrency Considerations

When multiple automations access the same datastore items simultaneously:

<Warning>
  There is no built-in race condition prevention in Datastore. Multiple automations attempting to write to the same datastore item may produce unexpected results.
</Warning>

- Consider implementing your own locking mechanism for critical datastore operations
- Use unique keys or sortFields when possible to avoid conflicts

## Storage Limits

### Collection Limits

#### Items per Collection

Each collection type has a maximum number of items it can contain:

<CardGroup cols="3">

    1,000 items per collection
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vault Collections" icon="lock">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit request">
    Contact our support team with specific details about which limits you need increased
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide justification">
    Explain your use case and why the current limits are insufficient
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review process">
    Our team will evaluate your request based on technical feasibility and account standing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    If approved, limit increases will be applied to your account
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

To work effectively within platform limits:

- **Design for Efficiency**: Break large automations into smaller, focused workflows
- **Implement Pagination**: Process large datasets in smaller batches
- **Use Webhooks**: Leverage webhooks for long-running processes rather than keeping automations active
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your usage against your plan limits
- **Clean Up Resources**: Remove unused automations, files, and data items
- **Optimize Storage**: Compress large files before storing them
- **Handle Race Conditions**: Design automations to avoid simultaneous writes to the same resources
- **Use Collections**: Organize related items into collections for better management
