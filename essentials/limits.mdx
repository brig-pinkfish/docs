Pinkfish implements resource limits to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and fair usage across all customers. These limits are designed to maintain platform stability while providing flexibility for your workflow needs.

## Rate Limits

Pinkfish enforces rate limits on API requests to protect platform stability and ensure fair usage. These limits apply per user, per organization.

| Service | Hourly Limit | Daily Limit | Description |
| :------ | :----------: | :---------: | :---------- |
| Platform MCP | 5,000/hr | 50,000/day | All MCP tool calls (code execution, memory, LLM, etc.) |
| PinkConnect | 25,000/hr | 100,000/day | All proxy requests through PinkConnect |
| Embedded MCPs | 5,000/hr | 50,000/day | All authenticated API endpoints (search, browser, LLM, etc.) |

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before retrying.

<Info>
  Rate limits use a sliding window algorithm, so usage is measured continuously rather than resetting at fixed intervals. Enterprise customers can request increased rate limits — contact your account team.
