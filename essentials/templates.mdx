## What are Workflow Templates?

Workflow Templates allow you to share your workflows as public templates that others can explore and clone. Turn your best workflows into templates with rich landing pages, making them easy for your team and the broader community to find and adopt.

## üîÑ How Template Cloning Works

**Important**: When someone clones your public template, they get a copy from your **latest published release**, not your current working version.

Here's why this matters:

- **Your working version** might have unpublished changes, experiments, or work-in-progress
- **Your published release** is the stable, tested version that actually works
- **Template clones** always come from the published release to ensure they work properly

**Example**: You're working on improvements to your "Customer Onboarding" workflow. You've made changes but haven't published them yet. When someone clones your template, they get the last working version you published, not your current draft with unfinished changes.

This ensures that people who clone your template get a working workflow, not a broken work-in-progress.

## üîó Resource Remapping: Your Data Stays Private

**Important**: When you make a template public, you're **only sharing the workflow structure**, not your actual data or connections.

Here's what happens when someone clones your template:

**What Gets Shared:**

- The workflow steps and logic
- Chat history to show how it works
- Instructions and descriptions

**What Stays Private (Yours):**

- Your database collections and data
- Your API connections and credentials
- Your files and stored information

**What the Cloner Needs to Provide:**

- Their own database collections
- Their own API connections (Salesforce, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Their own files and data sources

**Example**: You create a "Lead Management" template that connects to your Salesforce and stores data in your customer database. When someone clones it:

- They get the workflow logic for lead management
- They'll be prompted to connect their own Salesforce account
- They'll need to specify their own database collection for storing leads
- Your customer data and Salesforce connection remain completely private

This means you can safely share templates without worrying about exposing your private data or giving others access to your systems.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Specific Data Dependencies:**

If your workflow references specific files (e.g., "customer_list.csv") or specific database records (e.g., "Find record with ID 12345"), your template **will not work** for the person cloning it because they won't have those exact files or records.

**Solution**: Create multiple templates when needed:

1. **Setup Template**: Creates the required data structure, sample records, or files
2. **Main Template**: Uses the data created by the setup template

**Example**: For a "Customer Report Generator" that needs specific customer data:

- Template 1: "Customer Data Setup" - Creates sample customer records
- Template 2: "Customer Report Generator" - Generates reports using customer data

This way, users can first run the setup template to create the necessary data, then use the main template successfully.

## Key Features

### Public Landing Pages

- Create rich, informative landing pages for your workflows
- Add descriptions, use cases, and examples to help others understand your template
- Include creator attribution with names and avatars
- Version your content as you improve your templates

### Smart Cloning from Releases

- Templates are always cloned from your latest published release (never from your working version)
- Preserves the last 10 chat interactions so users can see how the workflow operates
- Maintains consistent workflow state across all components
- Ensures cloned workflows are stable and functional

### Public Sharing

- Make your workflows available as public templates for anyone to clone
- Once public, your template can be accessed and cloned by the community
- Create a public landing page that explains what your workflow does and how to use it

## How to Use Templates

### Creating a Template

1. **Build your workflow** and test it thoroughly
2. **Publish a release** to create a stable version (this is what gets cloned!)
3. **Create a landing page** with rich descriptions and examples
4. **Make it public** to share with your team or community

### Using Templates

1. **Find a public template** that solves a problem you have
2. **Review the landing page** to understand the workflow's purpose
3. **Preview chat history** to see how the workflow operates
4. **Clone the template** to create your own copy from the published release
5. **Customize as needed** for your specific use case
