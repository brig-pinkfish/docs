## How Batch Works

Break down large jobs into manageable pieces and process them through queues.

1. **Create batch** with unique batchId containing work items
2. **Assign workflow** to process each item
3. **Items placed in queue** for parallel processing
4. **Track completion** and trigger actions when batch finishes

## Batch Features

- **Unique Identification**: Each batch gets a unique batchId
- **Flexible Item Structure**: Define custom data for each item
- **Completion Actions**: Configure triggers, webhooks, or no action when batch completes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track batch progress and individual item status

## Queue Integration

Batch service integrates with Queue service:

- Batch items are placed into queues for processing
- Queue workers process individual items
- Queue tracking monitors batch completion
- Completion triggers fire when batches finish

For practical examples of using batches to handle complex workflows, see [Breaking Up Big Jobs](/how-to/breaking-big-jobs).
