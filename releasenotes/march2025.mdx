### 26 March

- Added "**Created by**" column in the automation library
- Added "**Status**" field in the connection page to show if the connection is active or disconnected
- **Quick heads-up: **We’re aware of a couple of quirks on the Library page. The “Last Updated” date isn’t displaying in the correct format, and to edit an automation, you currently need to click the “Edit” button instead of just selecting the automation row. Our team will be working on fixing these tomorrow. Just wanted to keep the users posted so you’re not caught off guard\!

Happy automating\! 🚀
