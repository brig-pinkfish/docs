## April 16, 2025

**Collections for Data Store, File Store, and Vault** We've introduced the concept of Collections for Data Store, File Store, and Vault.

- A Collection is now scoped to the organization in which it was createdâ€”it will only be visible to that org.
- You can share or delete an entire Collection as a single unit, making management simpler and more consistent.
- ðŸ“„ [Documentation â†’ Collections Guide](#)
- <Icon icon="circle-info" color="#ff0000" /> **Important Note** This feature upgrade
  may require manual steps on your end to ensure the workflow functions as expected.

      <Accordion title="Post Upgrade User Action Required (Show Details)" icon="circle-info">

  We have migrated to the new Data Collections model, where your Datastore, Vault, and Filestorage items will now exist within a "Collection" that can be shared to other individuals and to your organization.

  We discovered one edge case that we'd like to share with you that will require a workflow script change if you fit the criteria below.

  If you created a workflow prior to March 16th and used the Datastore, Filestore, Vault, or Browser-Login you will need to make a small modification to your script.

  Your script will invoke the datastore as shown here:

  ```
  const response = await fetch('<https://pinkfish.app/memory/items>', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${config.bearerToken}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Premium-Id': config.paragonIntegrations.pinkfishpremiumskills,
          'Automation-Id': config.automationId,
          'Automation-Name': config.automationName,
          'Run-Id': config.runId
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
      });

  ```

  The fetch path you see in your script will be slightly different depending on the service you are using:

  - Datastore will have: https://pinkfish.app/memory/items (as in example above)
  - Filestore will have: https://pinkfish.app/filestorage/items
  - Vault will have: https://pinkfish.app/memory/items?isSecret=true
  - Browser Login will have: https://apibrowserautomation-h2n6hq234q-uc.a.run.app/code-run

  To update to use the new Collections, you'll need to

  - change `config.bearerToken`
  - to `config.runtimeToken`

  And then re-run and re-publish.

      </Accordion>

**Billing & Usage Updates** - We've streamlined billing and usage visibility across plan tiers:

- Starter, Pro, and Teams customers can now:
  - Instantly sign up and pay for licenses
  - Get full transparency into credit usage
  - All details are available in the Billing & Usage Documentation
- Enterprise customers will have custom billing and usage arrangements. Billing views will not be available in-app.

**New Org Types: Enterprise Prime & Sub** Until now, all organizations functioned the same way. We're now introducing org types to distinguish between Enterprise and non-Enterprise accounts.

- Enterprise Prime Org:
  - Can create new orgs
  - Serves as the parent account for managing enterprise structure
- Enterprise Sub Orgs:
  - Cannot create new orgs
  - Function identically to current orgs otherwise

This change ensures better governance and clarity in multi-org enterprise setups.
