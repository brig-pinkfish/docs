**Collections for Data Store, File Store, and Vault **We‚Äôve introduced the concept of Collections for Data Store, File Store, and Vault.

- A Collection is now scoped to the organization in which it was created‚Äîit will only be visible to that org.
- You can share or delete an entire Collection as a single unit, making management simpler and more consistent.
- üìÑ [Documentation ‚Üí Collections Guide](#)
- <Icon icon="circle-info" color="#ff0000" /> **Important Note** This feature upgrade may require manual steps on your end to ensure the automation functions as expected.

  <Accordion title="Post Upgrade User Action Required (Show Details)" icon="circle-info">
    We have migrated to the new Data Collections model, where your Datastore, Vault, and Filestorage items will now exist within a ‚ÄúCollection‚Äù that can be shared to other individuals and to your organization.

    We discovered one edge case that we‚Äôd like to share with you that will require an automation script change if you fit the criteria below.

    If you created an automation prior to March 16th and used the Datastore, Filestore, Vault, or Browser-Login you will need to make a small modification to your script.

    Your script will invoke the datastore as shown here:

    ```
    const response = await fetch('<https://pinkfish.app/memory/items>', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${config.bearerToken}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Premium-Id': config.paragonIntegrations.pinkfishpremiumskills,
            'Automation-Id': config.automationId,
            'Automation-Name': config.automationName,
            'Run-Id': config.runId
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
        });
    
    ```

    The fetch path you see in your script will be slightly different depending on the service you are using:
    - Datastore will have: https://pinkfish.app/memory/items (as in example above)
    - Filestore will have: https://pinkfish.app/filestorage/items
    - Vault will have: https://pinkfish.app/memory/items?isSecret=true
    - Browser Login will have: https://apibrowserautomation-h2n6hq234q-uc.a.run.app/code-run

    To update to use the new Collections, you‚Äôll need to
    - change `config.bearerToken`
    - to `config.runtimeToken`

    And then re-run and re-publish.

**Billing & Usage Updates** - We've streamlined billing and usage visibility across plan tiers:

- Starter, Pro, and Teams customers can now:
  - Instantly sign up and pay for licenses
  - Get full transparency into credit usage
  - All details are available in the Billing & Usage Documentation
- Enterprise customers will have custom billing and usage arrangements. Billing views will not be available in-app.

**New Org Types: Enterprise Prime & Sub** Until now, all organizations functioned the same way. We‚Äôre now introducing org types to distinguish between Enterprise and non-Enterprise accounts.

- Enterprise Prime Org:
  - Can create new orgs
  - Serves as the parent account for managing enterprise structure
- Enterprise Sub Orgs:
  - Cannot create new orgs
  - Function identically to current orgs otherwise

This change ensures better governance and clarity in multi-org enterprise setups.
