## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how AI models can communicate with external tools and data sources. It's a protocol that enables AI agents to discover and use tools. 


## MCP Servers and Tools

- **MCP Server**: The container/application that hosts multiple tools and handles the MCP protocol communication
- **MCP Tool**: A specific function or capability (like "read file", "query database", "send email") that the server provides

Think of it this way: An MCP server is like a toolbox, while MCP tools are the individual tools inside that toolbox. The server manages authentication, connection handling, and tool discovery, while tools provide the actual functionality. 


## How MCPs work at Pinkfish 

In order for your agent to make use of MCP servers/tools, you'll first need to authenticate to the given service in Integrations. Eg: Google Drive. After you connect, your agents will be able to use any of the tools provided. For example, your Universal Agent will be able to list and maniupulate your Google Drive files. When you're building your custom agents, you can also add any of these servers to your agent; when you do that, your agent will recommend to users that they connect to the service(s) you've selected. So if you select Google Drive, for example, your agent will suggest to its users that they connect to *their own* Google Drive in order to make best use of your agent. In all cases, agents will only be able to access the user's own MCP Servers/Tool. 

### Coming soon: As mentioned above, the security model to date is that an agent can only access the logged-in user's integrations. However, we're working on a model where you can give your agent (as you're building it), permission to access specific tools from your (the builder's) integrations. For example, you might give your Onboarding Agent a Google Sheets read-only tool so that it can read checklists that you've created in your Google Sheets account.
