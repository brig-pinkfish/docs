## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how AI models can communicate with external tools and data sources. It's a protocol that enables AI agents to discover and use tools.

## MCP Servers and Tools

- **MCP Server**: The container/application that hosts multiple tools and handles the MCP protocol communication
- **MCP Tool**: A specific function or capability (like "read file", "query database", "send email") that the server provides

Think of it this way: An MCP server is like a toolbox, while MCP tools are the individual tools inside that toolbox. The server manages authentication, connection handling, and tool discovery, while tools provide the actual functionality.

## Authenticated Integrations and MCPs

In order for your agent to make use of authenticated MCP servers/tools, you'll first need to authenticate to the given service in Integrations. After you add an integration, your agents will be able use the tools provided for that integration. For example, if you authenticate to Google Drive, your agents will be able to use the Google Drive tools such as list files and write files.

## Sharing Agents, MCPs, and Permissions

The agent acts like your proxy, so it only has access to integrations to which you already have permission. When you share a custom agent, the integrations do NOT share along with it (similar to sharing a workflow). If you've created a "Google Drive Agent" and you share it, users of that agent will need to connect to their own Google Drives; they cannot use yours (unless you also decide to share your Google Drive connection with them).

## Pinkfish MCP servers

Each MCP server that is available has been created, verified, and is hosted by Pinkfish. We do not use any outside 3rd party MCP servers.

## Custom Agents and Suggested MCP Servers

When you're building custom agents, you may add an instruction to your agent that tells it to use a given service (see Preview tab in agent configuration). Eg: Google Drive. However, due to the authentication model above, while using an agent, it can only access your Google Drive. Other users of your custom agents will not be able to access your Google Drive. You can however, _suggest_ to users of your agent that they connect to their own services in order to make best use of the agent that you created.

### Coming soon - Shared Authenticated Tools

As mentioned above, the security model to date is that an agent can only access the logged-in user's integrations. However, we're working on a model where you can give your agent (as you're building it), permission to access specific tools from your (the builder's) integrations. For example, you might give your Onboarding Agent a Google Sheets read-only tool so that it can read checklists that you've created in your Google Sheets account.
