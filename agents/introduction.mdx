An agent is a configurable AI assistant. You define its behavior with instructions, choose which tools it can use (via MCP servers), and optionally attach resources and workflows.

## What an agent is

- **Instructions** — The system prompt. Defines behavior, tone, and expertise.
- **MCP servers** — Tools from integrations (Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, and many more). You select which servers the agent can use; it discovers and calls tools as needed. See [MCPs](/agents/mcps) for details.
- **Resources** (optional) — Datastores, filestores, and knowledge bases. You grant read/write/delete per resource.
- **Workflows** (optional) — Existing workflows the agent can invoke for multi-step processes.

## Where you can use agents

- **Web chat** — In the Pinkfish app
- **Slack** — Connect an agent to a Slack workspace
- **Microsoft Teams** — Connect an agent to a Teams tenant
- **API** — Use agent API keys for programmatic access. See [Agent Management](/api-reference/platform/agent-management).

## Agent types

- **Chat** — Standalone conversational agent
- **Workflow** — Agent bound to a specific workflow

## Key capabilities

- **Custom instructions** — Define behavior and tone
- **MCP tools** — Access tools from 100+ integrations; authenticate once in [Integrations](/api-reference/platform/connections), agents use your connections
- **Workflow orchestration** — Attach workflows for specialized processes
- **Sharing** — Share agents with your org via ACLs (integrations do not share; recipients connect their own)
