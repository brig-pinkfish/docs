Contact center agents, calls, queues, and recordings

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`talkdesk_get_users`](#talkdesk_get_users) | Get list of users in the Talkdesk account. Uses the Users API (users:read scope). |
| [`talkdesk_get_user`](#talkdesk_get_user) | Get detailed information about a specific user by ID. |
| [`talkdesk_get_contact`](#talkdesk_get_contact) | Retrieve a contact by ID (returns single contact) or search by phone number (returns paginated list). |
| [`talkdesk_request`](#talkdesk_request) | Make a raw API request to any Talkdesk endpoint. Use when you need to call APIs not covered by the specialized tools (e.g. ring-groups, data/reports/calls/jobs, recordings). Provide the path (with optional query string) and HTTP method. Access is gated by the connection's OAuth scopes - 401 means the token lacks the required scope for that path. Common paths: users, users/&#123;id&#125;, users/me, contacts, contacts/&#123;id&#125;, ring-groups, data/reports/calls/jobs, calls/&#123;id&#125;/recordings, recordings/&#123;id&#125;. |
