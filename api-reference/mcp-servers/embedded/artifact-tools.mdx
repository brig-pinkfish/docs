title: "Artifact Tools"
description: "Built-in agent tools for creating, reading, and listing downloadable files"
---

**Type:** Agent Built-in | **Server path:** N/A | **PCID required:** No

**Built-in and always available.** These tools are part of the agent runtime — no MCP server configuration or setup required. They are automatically available to every Claude and GPT agent. Unlike MCP server tools, artifact tools cannot be invoked directly via the API; they are only used by agents during conversation to create downloadable files, read truncated results, and list artifacts.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`write_artifact`](#write_artifact) | Create a downloadable file from text content |
| [`write_artifact_from_url`](#write_artifact_from_url) | Create a downloadable file by fetching from a URL |
| [`read_artifact`](#read_artifact) | Read content from an artifact by file ID (supports smart reading options) |
| [`list_artifacts`](#list_artifacts) | List all artifact files in the current chat session |

---

## write_artifact

Create a downloadable file from text content. Use when the user explicitly requests "save as", "export", "create file", or when generating code files.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | string | Yes | Name of the file with extension (e.g. `"data.csv"`) |
| `content` | string | Yes | The file content as a string |
| `fileType` | string | Yes | File extension/type: `csv`, `json`, `txt`, `md`, `html`, `js`, `ts`, `py` |

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | boolean | Whether the artifact was created |
| `filename` | string | Name of the created file |
| `url` | string | Download URL for the file |
| `id` | string | File ID (for referencing in `read_artifact`) |
| `mimeType` | string | MIME type of the file |
| `size` | number | File size in bytes |

---

## write_artifact_from_url

Create a downloadable file by fetching content from a URL. Use when you have a download URL from another tool (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, Slack) and want to save it as an artifact. The content is fetched server-side and never enters the agent's context, making it efficient for large files.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sourceUrl` | string | Yes | The URL to fetch the file content from |
| `filename` | string | Yes | Name for the artifact file with extension (e.g. `"report.pdf"`, `"data.xlsx"`) |
| `authHeaders` | object | No | Optional authentication headers to include when fetching from the source URL |

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | boolean | Whether the artifact was created |
| `filename` | string | Name of the created file |
| `url` | string | Download URL for the file |
| `id` | string | File ID |
| `mimeType` | string | MIME type of the file |
| `size` | number | File size in bytes |

**Note:** URL fetches are subject to SSRF protection. Localhost and private IP URLs are blocked. Maximum download size is 100MB.

## read_artifact

Retrieve content from an artifact file by its ID. Use when a tool result shows `_artifact.truncated: true` to get the full data. Supports selective reading to avoid fetching entire large files.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file_id` | string | Yes | The file ID of the artifact to read (e.g., `_artifact.id` from a truncated result) |
| `search` | string | No | Search pattern to find in the content (case-insensitive). Returns matching lines with context. |
| `context_lines` | number | No | Number of lines to show before and after each search match (default: 2) |
| `start_line` | number | No | Start line number for line range extraction (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| `end_line` | number | No | End line number for line range extraction (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| `json_path` | string | No | Dot notation path to extract from JSON content (e.g. `"data.items"`, `"results[0]"`) |
| `array_indices` | string | No | Comma-separated indices or ranges to extract from array content (e.g. `"0,1,2"` or `"0-5"`) |

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | boolean | Whether the read succeeded |
| `content` | string | File content (full or extracted) |
| `size` | number | File size in bytes |
| `filename` | string | File name |
| `mimeType` | string | MIME type |
| `mode` | string | When using smart options: `search`, `line_range`, `json_path`, or `array_indices` |

---

## list_artifacts

List all artifact files in the current chat session. Returns file names, IDs, sizes, MIME types, and creation dates.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `filter_type` | string | No | Filter by MIME type prefix (e.g. `"text/"`, `"application/json"`, `"image/"`) |
| `filter_name` | string | No | Filter by filename pattern (case-insensitive substring match) |

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `success` | boolean | Whether the list succeeded |
| `totalCount` | number | Total number of artifacts |
| `filteredCount` | number | Number after applying filters |
| `artifacts` | object[] | Array of artifact objects |
| `artifacts[].id` | string | File ID |
| `artifacts[].filename` | string | File name |
| `artifacts[].mimeType` | string | MIME type |
| `artifacts[].size` | number | File size in bytes |
| `artifacts[].sizeFormatted` | string | Human-readable size (e.g. "1.2 MB") |
| `artifacts[].createdAt` | string | Creation timestamp |
