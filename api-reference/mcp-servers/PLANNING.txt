# MCP Server Documentation Plan

## Objective

Create documentation pages for all MCP servers, organized into two sections:

- **`embedded/`** — Built-in platform servers (no external connection required)
- **`application/`** — External integration proxy servers (PCID required)

Each embedded server gets its own page following the standard format. Application servers are documented via a single index page with runtime discovery instructions.

## Folder Structure

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 — Embedded servers (23 pages)
Work through Priority 1–5 above. Each page requires:
1. Read the `tools.ts` file for the server
2. Extract all paramsSchema, outputSchema, descriptions
3. Write the page following the standard format
4. Add link from any platform guide page that references the server

### Phase 2 — Navigation
Once all pages are ready, add "MCP Servers" group to `docs.json` with two sub-groups:
- **Embedded Servers** — all embedded spec pages
- **Application Servers** — the overview/index page

## Total Documentation Scope

| Category | Servers | Tools (approx) | Pages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded (completed) | 4 | 37 | 4 + overview |
| Embedded (remaining) | 23 | ~110 | 23 |
| Application (production) | 105 | varies | overview |
| Application (not production-ready) | 2 | varies | — |
| **Total** | **134** | **~147+ embedded** | **28 + 2 overviews** |
