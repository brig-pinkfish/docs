## Welcome to the AI Automation API

This API enables you to execute AI-powered automations that you've created and published on our platform. With these endpoints, you can seamlessly integrate automated workflows into your applications and systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Automation**: A series of steps that perform a specific task or workflow.
- **Trigger**: A mechanism to initiate an automation via API call.
- **Run**: An instance of an automation being executed.

## Core Functionalities

1. **Execute Automations**: Trigger published automations via API calls using their associated triggers.
2. **Monitor Runs**: Track the status and results of automation executions through the platform interface.

## Execution Model

Our API follows a "fire and forget" model for automation execution:

- When you call an automation trigger, the API immediately returns a confirmation of receipt.
- The automation runs asynchronously in the background.
- Results are not directly returned via the API call.

To view the outcomes of an automation run, you have several options:
1. Check the effects of the automation (e.g., a created Google Doc).
2. Load the automation details in the platform UI.
3. Use the Run Monitor in the platform to view execution status and results.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header of each request:

```
X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

You can generate API keys in two ways:
1. In the Library section of the platform interface.
2. While setting up a trigger for an automation.

## Triggering Automations

Automations are executed by calling their associated triggers. Each trigger has a unique endpoint and may accept parameters either as query parameters (for GET requests) or as form-encoded data (for POST requests).

### Request Formats

For trigger calls, the API supports two methods of passing parameters:

1. Query Parameters: For GET requests or simple data.
2. Form Data: For POST requests, use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

<Note>
  The API does not support JSON payloads for automation execution. Ensure all POST requests use form-encoded data.
</Note>

## Getting Started

To begin using the AI Automation API, you'll need to:

1. Create and publish an automation using our platform.
2. Set up a trigger for your automation.
3. Generate an API key from either the Library section or during trigger setup.
4. Use the provided trigger endpoint to execute your automation, including your API key in the request header.
