Two server types: **embedded** (no connection) and **application** (Gmail, Slack, etc. — require PCID per call). Set up connections on the [Integrations](https://app.pinkfish.ai/integrations) page in the Pinkfish web app. Get PCIDs from `capabilities_discover` or the [PinkConnect API](#listing-connections).

A **PCID** (PinkConnect ID) identifies a specific OAuth connection to an external service. It is used only with **application MCPs** — embedded MCPs do not use PCIDs. Pass the PCID in tool arguments so the MCP Farm knows which connection to use (e.g. which Gmail account).

## Embedded MCPs

**Embedded MCPs** are built-in platform services — code execution, AI models, data storage, web search, and more. No connection or PCID required; authenticate and call. See the [Embedded MCPs overview](/api-reference/mcp-servers/embedded/overview) for the full list.

## Application MCPs

**Application MCPs** are proxies to external services (Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, etc.). Each requires a connection in PinkConnect and a PCID per tool call. Set up connections on the [Integrations](https://app.pinkfish.ai/integrations) page. See the [Application MCPs overview](/api-reference/mcp-servers/application/overview) for the full list.

## Listing Connections

### PinkConnect API

**Base URL:** `https://proxy.pinkfish.ai`

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://proxy.pinkfish.ai/manage/user-connections" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

| Query param | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `statuses`  | Comma-separated: `connected`, `error`, `disconnected`. Default: all. |

**Response:** Array of connections. Each `id` is the PCID.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123-def456",
    "name": "My Gmail",
    "service_key": "gmail",
    "status": "connected"
  },
  {
    "id": "ghi789-jkl012",
    "name": "My Slack",
    "service_key": "slack",
    "status": "connected"
  }
]
```

### Discovery

Use `capabilities_discover` for task-relevant connections. PCIDs are in `connections[].id`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai/pinkfish-sidekick" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "capabilities_discover",
      "arguments": {
        "request": "search my gmail"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Using a PCID

Pass the PCID as an argument when calling an application MCP tool:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai/gmail" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "gmail_search_emails",
      "arguments": {
        "PCID": "abc123-def456",
        "query": "is:unread"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```
