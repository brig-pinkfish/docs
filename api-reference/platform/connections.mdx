The MCP Farm has two server types: embedded (built-in, no connection) and application (Gmail, Slack, etc., require a PCID per call).

**Connections:** Set up in the Pinkfish app under **Integrations**. PCIDs come from `capabilities_discover` or the [PinkConnect API](#listing-connections).

## Embedded MCPs

**Built-in platform services** that do not require external user connections. These work out of the box with just a runtime token.

**Key characteristic:** No `PCID` required. Embedded tools use org-scoped identifiers like `collectionId` where needed.

## Application MCPs

**Third-party integrations** that connect to external services via OAuth or API keys. These require the user to set up a connection through PinkConnect, and each tool call requires a `PCID` (PinkConnect connection ID) that identifies which connection to use.

| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `gmail`             | Gmail API                  |
| `slack`             | Slack API                  |
| `salesforce`        | Salesforce API             |
| `google-drive`      | Google Drive file storage  |

| `microsoft-outlook` | Outlook email and calendar |
| `microsoft-teams`   | Microsoft Teams API        |
| `sharepoint`        | SharePoint API             |
| `hubspot`           | HubSpot CRM                |
| `jira`              | Jira API                   |
| `linear`            | Linear API                 |
| `github`            | GitHub API                 |
| `snowflake`         | Snowflake data warehouse   |
| `notion`            | Notion API                 |
| ...                 | 100+ more integrations     |

**Key characteristic:** Every tool call must include a `PCID` argument.

## What is a PCID?

A **PCID** (PinkConnect Connection ID) is a unique identifier for a specific OAuth connection to an external service. When you connect your Gmail account, Salesforce instance, or any other external service through PinkConnect, each connection gets a PCID.

You need to include the PCID in tool arguments so the MCP Farm knows which connection to use. For example, if you have two Gmail accounts connected, the PCID tells it which one to search.

## Listing Connections

### PinkConnect API

**Base URL:** `https://proxy.pinkfish.ai`

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://proxy.pinkfish.ai/manage/user-connections" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

| Query param | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `statuses`  | Comma-separated: `connected`, `error`, `disconnected`. Default: all. |

**Response:** Array of connections. Each `id` is the PCID.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123-def456",
    "name": "My Gmail",
    "service_key": "gmail",
    "status": "connected"
  },
  {
    "id": "ghi789-jkl012",
    "name": "My Slack",
    "service_key": "slack",
    "status": "connected"
  }
]
```

### Discovery

Use `capabilities_discover` for task-relevant connections. PCIDs are in `connections[].id`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai/pinkfish-sidekick" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "capabilities_discover",
      "arguments": {
        "request": "search my gmail"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Using a PCID

Pass the PCID as an argument when calling an application MCP tool:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai/gmail" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "gmail_search_emails",
      "arguments": {
        "PCID": "abc123-def456",
        "query": "is:unread"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```
