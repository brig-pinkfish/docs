## Overview

The Pinkfish Platform API gives you programmatic access to the full power of the Pinkfish MCP Farm — a unified gateway to **1500+ tools**. With a single authentication flow and a consistent protocol, you can:

- **Search the web**, generate AI content, process documents, and more — using built-in platform tools
- **Connect to external services** like Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Jira, and 100+ others via OAuth-based connections
- **Discover tools dynamically** using natural language — ask "what tools can send an email?" and get actionable results
- **Execute code** in a sandboxed environment that can chain multiple tool calls together
- **Build workflows** — persistent, versioned automations with triggers, scheduling, and resource bindings
- **Automate browsers** using natural language — describe what you want and watch AI navigate, click, and extract data

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **API Key** | An account-level key created in the Pinkfish web app. Used to obtain a runtime token. |
| **Runtime Token** | A JWT returned by the `/auth/token` endpoint. Authorizes all MCP Farm calls. |
| **MCP Farm** | The unified API gateway that hosts all tool servers. Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS. |
| **MCP Server** | A named collection of related tools (e.g., `gmail`, `web-search`, `browser-automation`). |
| **Tool** | A single callable action on a server (e.g., `gmail_search_emails`, `search_googlesearch`). |
| **PCID** | PinkConnect Connection ID — identifies a specific OAuth connection for external services. |

## Base URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Platform API** | `https://app-api.app.pinkfish.ai` |
| **MCP Farm** | `https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai` |
| **PinkConnect** | `https://proxy.pinkfish.ai` |

## Prerequisites

1. A Pinkfish account
2. An API key — create one in **Settings → API Keys → Create**

<Warning>
Copy the API key value immediately — it is shown only once. It can take up to 60 seconds for a new API key to activate.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

The full flow from authentication to calling a tool:

```bash
# 1. Exchange your API key for a runtime token
export PINKFISH_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "https://app-api.app.pinkfish.ai/auth/token" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Selected-Org: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq -r '.token')

# 2. Call a tool (example: web search)
curl -s -X POST "https://mcp.app.pinkfish.ai/web-search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINKFISH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "search_googlesearch",
      "arguments": { "query": "latest AI news" }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```
