The Agentic Editor lets you build powerful automation workflows by simply describing what you want done in natural language. An AI agent interprets your intent, writes the code, configures the steps, and connects your tools -- so you can focus on the outcome, not the implementation.

## How It Works

1. **Describe your workflow** -- Tell the agent what you want to automate in plain English
2. **The agent builds it** -- The AI agent creates the steps, writes the code, and wires up your integrations
3. **Review and run** -- Review what the agent built, make adjustments if needed, and run your workflow

## Get Started

The best way to get started is to open the Pinkfish app, create a new workflow, and start describing what you want to build. The AI agent will guide you from there.
